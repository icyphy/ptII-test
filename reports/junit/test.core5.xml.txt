    [junit] Warning: In 'ptolemy.actor.lib.io.FileReader'
    [junit]   The getName() method returns
    [junit]    'fileOrURL' but the  field is named
    [junit]    'fileOrURLPort'
    [junit]    This is technically a violation  of the coding standard,
    [junit]    but permissible because the name  ends in 'Port'
