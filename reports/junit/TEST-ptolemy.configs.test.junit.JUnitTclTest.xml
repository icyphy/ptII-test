Warning: In 'ptolemy.actor.lib.io.FileReader'
  The getName() method returns
   'fileOrURL' but the  field is named
   'fileOrURLPort'
   This is technically a violation  of the coding standard,
   but permissible because the name  ends in 'Port'

The constraints of the master:
  1. (TypeConstant, arrayType(double,2)) <= (variable .Top.Map.origin: arrayType(double))
  2. (TypeConstant, double) <= (variable .Top.Map.resolution: double)
  3. (TypeConstant, {grid = arrayType(int,2), height = int, width = int}) <= (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int})
  4. (port .Top.Map.map: unknown) <= (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int})
  5. (variable .Top.Map.map: {grid = arrayType(int), height = int, width = int}) <= (port .Top.Map.map: unknown)
The constraints of the clone:
