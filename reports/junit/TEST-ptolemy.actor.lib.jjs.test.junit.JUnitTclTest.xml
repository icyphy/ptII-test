This is the first time that the reloadAllAccessors method has been invoked in this JVM, so the the accessors repo will be checked out or updated and JSDoc invoked. Note that running the tests may end up invoking a new JVM for each directory, so the repo may be checked out or updated and JSDoc invoked more than once when the tests are run.
