testDefs.tcl: setting time out to 9000 seconds at Sun Oct 27 06:41:47 UTC 2019
Below are the system properties. To determine which Travis test is failing, look for a property that starts with PT_TRAVIS_TEST


==== $PTII/ptolemy/util/test/travis/TravisTimeout.tcl: TravisTimeout-1.1 Fail a test signifying a timeout problem with Travis
==== Contents of test case:

    set travisTest {Unknown}
    puts "Below are the system properties. To determine which Travis test is failing, look for a property that starts with PT_TRAVIS_TEST"

    set envs [java::call System getenv]
    set names [[$envs keySet] iterator]
    while { [$names hasNext] } {
	set name [$names next]
        if {[string first {PT_TRAVIS_TEST} $name] != -1} {
            set travisTest $name
            break
        }
	# puts "$name=[$envs get $name]"
    }

    error "$travisTest timed out!\n    This test always fails.  It is called by $PTII/bin/ptIITravisBuild.sh to signify that Travis is having timeout problems.  Typically this is caused by OpenCV being rebuilt.  The problem should go away with the next build after OpenCV is updated in the cache.  See https://wiki.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/Main/Travis#Caching_2"
