     [echo]       This target runs a test that will fail, indicating a timeout problem with Travis.
     [echo] 
     [echo]       If the Travis continuous integration system needs to update the OpenCV cache,
     [echo]       then there is a chance that building OpenCV will take up too much time and the
     [echo]       rest of the build will fail.
     [echo] 
     [echo]       If too much time is taken up, then we should skip running the tests, but
     [echo]       then we need to have a test failure that indicates that the other tests did not run.
