  <description>
Convert discrete events at the input to a continuous-time&#10; signal at the output by holding the value of the discrete&#10; event until the next discrete event arrives. Specifically,&#10; on each firing, if an input is present, then record the&#10; value of the input. Then produce the recorded value.&#10; Prior to receipt of the first input, output the token&#10; given by &lt;i&gt;defaultValue&lt;/i&gt;, if one is given.&#10; This actor will throw an exception if the input is not&#10; purely discrete. Specifically, this means that when the input&#10; is present, the step size of the solver has to be 0.0.  </description>
