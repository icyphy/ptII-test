  <description>
A merge actor for the Continuous domain. This port has a multiport&#10; input and on each firing, sends the input from channel 0 to the&#10; output, if the input at channel 0 is present. Otherwise, it sends&#10; the input from channel 1, if it is present. It continues to search&#10; the inputs in channel order until it finds one that is present&#10; or it runs out of input channels. In the latter case, the output&#10; will be absent.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; By default, this actor discards data on all channels after&#10; the first channel that has present data. If you set the &lt;i&gt;discard&lt;/i&gt;&#10; parameter to false, however, then it will collect all present&#10; data in queue and output it in the next microstep until all&#10; present inputs have been produced on the output.&#10; Note that setting this to false creates a risk of a chattering&#10; Zeno system if a continuous signal is provided as input.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note that this actor can merge continuous signals with discrete&#10; ones, but the resulting signal may not be piecewise continuous.&#10; This will be a bit odd. It is most useful to merge discrete signals&#10; or signals that are piecewise continuous.  </description>
