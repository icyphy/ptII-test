  <description>
An HybridModalDirector governs the execution of the discrete dynamics of a hybrid&#10; system model. It extends ModalDirector by implementing the ContinuousStatefulComponent&#10; and ContinuousStepSizeController interfaces by delegating the function of those&#10; interfaces to the currently active state refinement.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note that when a multi-step solver is used, the guards on the transitions are&#10; only evaluated when either the step size is zero or the multi-step solver has&#10; just completed its last step. The guards are not evaluated during intermediate&#10; steps.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This director is based on HSFSMDirector by Xiaojun Liu and Haiyang Zheng.  </description>
