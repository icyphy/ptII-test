Given any new input event, produce on the output channels the current value&#10; of all the corresponding input channels. If an input channel has not yet&#10; received any value and has no default value, then no output is produced.&#10; If any input channel has most recently received a &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../ptolemy/data/SmoothToken.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.data.SmoothToken&lt;/a&gt;,&#10; then the value of that token is extrapolated to the current time to get&#10; the current value.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor has a &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; port, which, if connected, will determine&#10; when outputs are sent. That is, if this port is connected, then outputs&#10; will be produced only when an event is received on some channel of the&#10; trigger port.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor is no longer needed, since retrieving a SmoothToken from an input&#10; port will automatically be extrapolated to the current time. You can use the&#10; ordinary Sampler actor instead.  </description>
