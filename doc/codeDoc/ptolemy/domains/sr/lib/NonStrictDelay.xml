  <description>
A nonstrict actor that delays tokens by one iteration.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor provides a one-tick delay.  On each firing, it produces&#10; on the output port whatever value it read on the input port in the&#10; previous tick of the clock. If the input was absent on the previous&#10; tick of the clock, then the output will be absent. On the first tick,&#10; the output is &lt;i&gt;initialValue&lt;/i&gt; if it is given, and absent otherwise.&#10; In contrast to the Pre actor, this actor is non-strict, and hence can&#10; break causality loops.  Whereas Pre provides a one-step delay of&#10; non-absent values, this actor simply delays by one clock tick.  </description>

    <property name="initialValue">Initial token value.  This defaults to no value, which results&#10;  in the first output being absent. If a value is given, then&#10;  output will be constrained to have at least the type of the value&#10;  (as well as at least the type of the input).</property>
