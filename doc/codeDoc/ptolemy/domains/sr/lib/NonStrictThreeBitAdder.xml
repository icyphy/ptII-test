  <description>
A nonstrict three-bit adder.  This adder has one input port, which is a&#10; multiport, and two output ports, which are single ports.  All of the ports&#10; are of type int, and inputs are outputs are single bits.  An exception is&#10; thrown if a number other than 0 or 1 is received as an input, or if there&#10; are not exactly three channels connected to the input port.  This actor&#10; adds the three input bits, and outputs the result to the lowBit and highBit&#10; ports.  Only two of the inputs must be known for highBit to be determined.&#10; All inputs are necessary for lowBit to be determined.  An absence of a token&#10; is considered to have no contribution to the sum (same as value the zero).&#10; If no input tokens are available at all, then no output is produced.  </description>
