  <description>
A distributor that splits an input stream into a set of output&#10; streams. The distributor has an input port and an output port, the&#10; latter of which is a multiport.  The types of the ports are undeclared&#10; and will be resolved by the type resolution mechanism, with the&#10; constraint that the output type must be greater than or equal to the&#10; input type. On each call to the fire method, the actor reads at most&#10; one token from the input, and writes one token to an output channel.&#10; If there is no token on the input, then it will not produce a token on&#10; the current output.  In the next iteration of this actor, it will&#10; produce an output on the next channel.  </description>
