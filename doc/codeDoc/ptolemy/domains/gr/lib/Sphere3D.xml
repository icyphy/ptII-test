  <description>
This actor contains the geometry and appearance specifications for a&#10; sphere.  The output port is used to connect this actor to the Java3D scene&#10; graph. This actor may be used along with the Scale3D transformer to produce&#10; ellipsoid shapes. This actor will only have meaning in the GR domain.&#10; Note that most of the parameters are described in the base class documentation.  </description>

    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="divisions">The number of divisions in the sphere. This is an integer with&#10;  default value &quot;max(6, roundToInt(radius * 300))&quot;. This parameter&#10;  determines the resolution of the sphere, which is approximated&#10;  as a surface composed of triangular facets. Increasing this&#10;  value makes the surface smoother, but also increases the cost&#10;  of rendering.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="radius">The radius of the sphere. This is a double with default 0.1.</property>
