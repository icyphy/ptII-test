  <description>
An attribute associated with Ptera events containing executable actions. The&#10; actions are written as assignments separated with semicolons. They can be&#10; executed either to change the values of the variables assigned to, or to send&#10; output tokens to ports.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This class is similar to &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../ptolemy/domains/modal/kernel/CommitActionsAttribute.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.domains.modal.kernel.CommitActionsAttribute&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../ptolemy/domains/modal/kernel/OutputActionsAttribute.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.domains.modal.kernel.OutputActionsAttribute&lt;/a&gt; in FSM. The difference is that in Ptera, no distinction&#10; is made between commit actions and output actions. The destination of an&#10; assignment can be either a variable or a port. If a port and a variable have&#10; the same name in a Ptera model, then assigning to that name causes output to&#10; be sent to the port instead of changing the value of the variable.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Another difference between this class and those in FSM is that in Ptera, events&#10; are allowed to receive parameters. The parameters can be referred to in the&#10; actions associated with that event.  </description>
