  <description>
This parameter sets whether execution of a Ptera model is synchronized to real&#10; time. If it is added to a Ptera controller and it has value true, then the&#10; Ptera controller delays its event processing to try to keep real time&#10; synchronized with the advance of model time by incurring real-time delays in&#10; the execution.  </description>
