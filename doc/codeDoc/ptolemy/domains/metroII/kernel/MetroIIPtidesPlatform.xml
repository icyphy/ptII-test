  <description>
This composite implements a Ptides platform, which is used for the design of&#10; distributed real-time systems. The main reason for implementing this&#10; composite is to allow for special treatment of tokens on input and output&#10; ports. Ptides platforms can only contain the following ports: SensorPort,&#10; ActuatorPort, NetworkReceiverPort, NetworkTransmitterPort. A Ptides platform&#10; must contain a PtidesDirector.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Network ports receive and transmit RecordTokens that encapsulate Ptides events&#10; (timestamp and value). A NetworkReceiverPort extracts the timestamp of the&#10; Ptides event in the RecordToken and creates a new event on the event queue on&#10; the PtidesDirector with this timestamp.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; FIXME: The base class seems to have some support for ParameterPorts but&#10; nothing that really works?&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This class is identical to PtidesPlatform except ports are mapped to&#10; MetroIIPtidesPort, composite actors are mapped to MetroIICompositeActor, and&#10; Ptides director is mapped to MetroIIPtidesDirector.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;  </description>
