  <description>
MetroIISRDirector is a Synchronous Reactive (SR) director that adapts to&#10; MetroII semantics.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; In MetroIISRDirector, the actor firing will first trigger a MetroII event to&#10; be PROPOSED. The firing will not be executed until the MetroII event is&#10; NOTIFIED. In other words, all the actors under MetroIISRDirector are&#10; considered as MetroII actors.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; By using a MetroIISRDirector, the user understands the firing of the MetroII&#10; actor might be affected by MetroIIDirector on the upper level and the&#10; architectural model which the MetroII actor is mapped onto. This introduces&#10; some non-determinisms and thus the way it reaches the fixed point depends on&#10; the architectural implementation. The MetroIISRDirector guarantees that the&#10; states are not updated (postfire() are not called) until the model reaches&#10; the fixed point. These non-determinisms are desirable and can be used to&#10; optimize the architectures.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;  </description>
