&lt;p&gt;&#10; MetroIIPNDirector extends PNDirector and implements the MetroIIEventHandler&#10; interface. In addition to being blocked on read or write, the actors governed&#10; by MetroIIPNDirector may be blocked by MetroII events: 'Get.End' or&#10; 'Put.Begin'. 'Get.End' is PROPOSED after a token is successfully obtained&#10; from the receiver. And the actor is blocked until 'Get.End' is NOTIFIED.&#10; 'Put.Begin' is PROPOSED before trying to put a token into the receiver.&#10; Similarly, the actor is blocked until 'Put.Begin' is NOTIFIED.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Known issue: threads created by Yieldadapter correctly stop but the ones&#10; created by ProcessDirector do not. It seems stop() is called for each thread&#10; in ProcessDirector.stop() but no effect can be observed. Don't know why. BTW,&#10; stop() is a deprecated function in java.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The implementation is obsolete and needs to be updated.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;  </description>
