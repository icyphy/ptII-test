  <description>
This composite implements a Ptides platform,&#10;  which is used for the design of distributed real-time systems.&#10;  The main reason for implementing this composite is to allow for&#10;  special treatment of tokens on input and output ports. Ptides&#10;  platforms can only contain the following ports: SensorPort,&#10;  ActuatorPort, NetworkReceiverPort, NetworkTransmitterPort.&#10;  A Ptides platform must contain a PtidesDirector.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  Network ports receive and transmit RecordTokens that encapsulate&#10;  Ptides events (timestamp and value).&#10;  A NetworkReceiverPort extracts the timestamp of the&#10;  Ptides event in the RecordToken and creates a new event on the&#10;  event queue on the PtidesDirector with this timestamp.&#10;&#10;  FIXME: The base class seems to have some support for&#10;  ParameterPorts but nothing that really works?  </description>
