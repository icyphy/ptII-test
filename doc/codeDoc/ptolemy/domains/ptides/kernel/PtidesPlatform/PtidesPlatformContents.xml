  <description>
This is a specialized composite actor for use in PtidesPlatform.&#10;  In particular, it ensures that if ports are added or deleted&#10;  locally, then corresponding ports will be added or deleted&#10;  in the container.  That addition will result in appropriate&#10;  connections being made.  </description>
