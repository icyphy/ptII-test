Cellular Automata 2D Convolution Actor.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The CA2DConvolution actor should be used in conjunction with the CADirector.&#10; To use this actor, it is highly recommended to start with one of the&#10; examples.  The examples have the required variables (used by the&#10; director) added to the canvas and connected to the correct input and&#10; output ports of the CA2DConvolution actor.  The actor should be used to perform&#10; convolution operations in discrete two-dimensional (2D) space.  The&#10; inputs are: i and j, the x and yLocation of the current space on the&#10; 2D grid; the currentValue of the space (i,j) on the grid; and the&#10; currentValues of all neighboring cells in the grid.  The output is&#10; the newValue at 2D grid position (i,j).&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
