  <description>
Chopstick in the Dining Philosophers demo. Each Chopstick can only be&#10; used by one philosopher at a time. When it is not being used it can be&#10; claimed by either of the two philosophers next to it. Once it has been&#10; claimed, it is not available until it is released by the philosopher&#10; holding it.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor has four ports, each of width one: two are used to communicate&#10; with the philosopher on the left, and two are used to communicate with&#10; the buffer on the right. Two ports are needed to communicate with each&#10; philosopher as the philosopher holds the chopstick for some random time.&#10; &lt;p&gt;  </description>
