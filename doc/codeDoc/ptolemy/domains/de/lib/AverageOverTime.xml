  <description>
An actor to compute the average of the input values received so far over model&#10; time. This actor can fire whenever there is a token at its input port, or the&#10; model time has advanced since last firing. It records the last token that it&#10; received. In each firing, the produce of the last token and the amount of model&#10; time increment is added to a sum variable. The average value received so far is&#10; obtained by dividing the sum by the current model time. This average is sent to&#10; the output port in each firing. If a token is available at the input port, this&#10; actor reads that token and overwrites the last token with it.  </description>
