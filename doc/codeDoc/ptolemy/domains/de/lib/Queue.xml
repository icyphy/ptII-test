  <description>
This actor implements a queue.  When a token is received on the&#10; &lt;i&gt;input&lt;/i&gt; port, it is stored in the queue.&#10; When the &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; port receives a token, the oldest element in the&#10; queue is produced on the output.  If there is no element in the queue when a&#10; token is received on the &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; port, then no output is&#10; produced. In this circumstance, if &lt;i&gt;persistentTrigger&lt;/i&gt; is true&#10; then the next time an input is received, it is sent immediately to&#10; the output.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The inputs can be of any token type, and the output&#10; is constrained to be of a type at least that of the input. If&#10; the &lt;i&gt;capacity&lt;/i&gt; parameter is negative or zero (the default),&#10; then the capacity is infinite. Otherwise, the capacity is&#10; given by that parameter, and inputs received when the queue&#10; is full are discarded. Whenever the size of the queue changes,&#10; the new size is produced on the &lt;i&gt;size&lt;/i&gt; output port.&#10; If an input arrives at the same time that an output is&#10; produced, then the &lt;i&gt;size&lt;/i&gt; port gets two events at&#10; the same time.  </description>

    <!--ptolemy.actor.TypedIOPort-->
    <port name="size">The current size of the queue. This port produces an output&#10;  whenever the size changes. It has type int.</port>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.TypedIOPort-->
    <port name="trigger">The trigger port, which has undeclared type. If this port&#10;  receives a token, then the oldest token in the queue&#10;  will be emitted on the &lt;i&gt;output&lt;/i&gt; port.</port>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="capacity">The capacity of the queue. If the value is positive, then&#10;  it specifies the capacity of the queue. If it is negative&#10;  or 0, then it specifies that the capacity is infinite.&#10;  This is an integer with default 0.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="persistentTrigger">If set to true, then if a &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; arrives when the&#10;  queue is empty, it is remembered, and the next time an&#10;  &lt;i&gt;input&lt;/i&gt; arrives, it is sent immediately to the output.&#10;  This is a boolean with default false.</property>
