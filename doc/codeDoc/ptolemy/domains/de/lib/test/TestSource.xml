This actor fires itself five times at each time instant,&#10; then repeats the cycle one time unit later.  It outputs a ramp,&#10; starting at zero and incrementing by one each time.&#10; If there is an input, it adds the input to the ramp output.&#10; This actor is designed to test two features of the DE scheduler.&#10; First, that an iteration processes all events of a given time&#10; stamp.  And second, that self-scheduling events are processed&#10; in the proper order, with proper priorities.  To do these&#10; tests, connect two of these actors in cascade.  </description>
