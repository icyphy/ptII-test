  <description>
A DE actor to compare the time stamps of events at its two input ports, and&#10; output the difference. Every time an event can be processed either at input&#10; port &lt;code&gt;input1&lt;/code&gt; or at &lt;code&gt;input2&lt;/code&gt;, the event is consumed. The&#10; value that the event carries is insignificant, but the time stamp of the event&#10; is recorded in a local list. Time stamps received at the two input ports are&#10; stored in two different lists. Every time when both lists have data, the&#10; difference between the top elements of the lists is obtained, and is sent to&#10; the output port. This done by subtracting the time stamp of every top event in&#10; the list for &lt;code&gt;input2&lt;/code&gt; with the time stamp of every top event in the&#10; list for &lt;code&gt;input1&lt;/code&gt;.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor could potentially consume an infinite amount of memory if the&#10; arrival rates of events at the two input ports are different, because one of&#10; the lists keeps growing.  </description>
