This actor models a preemptive server with a fixed or variable service time.&#10; A server is either busy (serving a customer) or not busy at any given time.&#10; If an input arrives when the server is not busy, then the input token is&#10; produced on the output with a delay given by the &lt;i&gt;serviceTime&lt;/i&gt;&#10; parameter.&#10; If an input arrives while the server is busy, then that input is&#10; queued until the server becomes free, at which point it is produced&#10; on the output with a delay given by the &lt;i&gt;serviceTime&lt;/i&gt; parameter&#10; value at the time that the input arrived.&#10; If several inputs arrive while the server is busy, then they are&#10; served in an order determined by the value of the &lt;i&gt;priority&lt;/i&gt;&#10; parameter at the time of arrival of the input, and for inputs with&#10; identical priorities, on a first-come, first-served basis.&#10; On every firing, produce an output indicating the final queue size.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The service time and priority used for a job are the most recently arrived&#10; values prior to or simultaneous with the &lt;i&gt;arrival&lt;/i&gt; of the job&#10; (not with the time at which service begins). Thus, if you want&#10; each job to have an independent service time or priority, you should&#10; provide each parameter as an input synchronized with each new job arrival.  </description>

    <!--ptolemy.actor.TypedIOPort-->
    <port name="size">The current size of the queue. This port produces an output&#10;  whenever the size changes. It has type int.</port>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="capacity">The capacity of the queue. If the value is positive, then&#10;  it specifies the capacity of the queue. If it is negative&#10;  or 0, then it specifies that the capacity is infinite.&#10;  This is an integer with default 0.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.PortParameter-->
    <property name="serviceTime">The service time. This is a double with default 1.0.&#10;  It is required to be non-negative.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.PortParameter-->
    <property name="priority">The priority. This is a double with default 0.0.&#10;  A higher priority implies the task has precedence over tasks&#10;  with lower priority values.</property>
