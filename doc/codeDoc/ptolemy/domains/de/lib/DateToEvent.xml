  <description>
A timed actor that accepts DateTokens on the input. If the date in&#10;  the DateToken is in the future, the output is generated at this&#10;  future date. If the date is in the past, an exception is thrown.&#10;  The output is a DateToken with the system time obtained when producing&#10;  the output. Internally, the input date is converted to model time, which&#10;  is used in the local clock of the director.&#10;  Because we are using system time here, the output time will not be&#10;  exact and the output DateToken will not be exactly the same as the&#10;  DateToken received on the input.&#10;&#10;  Using this actor makes sense in models that synchronize to real time&#10;  (e.g. in the DE domain by enabling the synchronizeToRealTime property).  </description>
