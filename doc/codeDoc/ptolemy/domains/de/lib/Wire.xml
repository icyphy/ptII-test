  <description>
A Wire is a stateful actor in DE.  It should have an equal number&#10; of input and output channels.  If it receives input on &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of&#10; its channels, it will produce the most recent received on each&#10; input channel to the corresponding output channel for &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt;&#10; channels. We can think its behavior similar to a wire in VHDL, where&#10; the value is always the most recently received. If no input has been&#10; received on an input channel, then the corresponding output channel&#10; will get the value given by &lt;i&gt;initialValue&lt;/i&gt;, possibly converted&#10; to the type of the output. The type of the output is at least that&#10; of the input and that of &lt;i&gt;initialValue&lt;/i&gt;. Hence, for example,&#10; if the input&#10; is a double and &lt;i&gt;initialValue&lt;/i&gt; is an int, then the output will&#10; be a double.  </description>
