  <description>
A timed actor that outputs the local clock value that corresponds to the date.&#10;  Such a correspondence is only given in models that synchronize to real time.&#10;  In such models, the real time (date) when the model starts is recorded. An input&#10;  date to this actor is compared to the model start date. The difference between&#10;  those dates (in millisecond resolution) is multiplied by the time resolution of&#10;  the local clock and then send to the output.&#10;&#10;  Currently, this actor only works in the DE domain.  </description>
