  <description>
A queue that outputs the next token to an output channel that is ready to&#10; receive it. It can have multiple output channels, and the same number of&#10; trigger channels. Initially all output channels are assumed to be ready. When a&#10; token is available, it is sent to the first channel that is ready, and that&#10; channel is marked not ready. When all channels are not ready, the token would&#10; be queued. If the number of tokens already in the queue is equal to the queue&#10; capacity (0 means infinity), then new tokens are lost.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; To make an output channel ready after a token is sent to it, a triggering&#10; signal needs to be received in the corresponding channel of the trigger port.  </description>
