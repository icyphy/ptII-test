On each iteration, this actor produces the token received on the previous&#10; iteration. On the first iteration, it produces the token given by the&#10; &lt;i&gt;initialValue&lt;/i&gt; parameter, if such a value has been set.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Although it might be tempting to try, this actor is not very useful&#10; for breaking precedences in a feedback loop in DE, the way the&#10; TimedDelay actor in DE or the SampleDelay actor in SDF do.&#10; Since it does not trigger until there is an input, it will not&#10; actually break the precedences in a feedback loop.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The output data type is constrained to be at least as general&#10; as both the input and the &lt;i&gt;initialValue&lt;/i&gt; parameter.  </description>

    <property name="initialValue">The initial output value. If this is set, it specifies the&#10;  first output value produced when the first input arrives.&#10;  If it is not set, then no output is produced on the first&#10;  firing.</property>
