This actor is an &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../ptolemy/actor/CommunicationAspect.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.actor.CommunicationAspect&lt;/a&gt; that, when its&#10;  &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../../ptolemy/domains/de/lib/aspect/TTESwitch.html#sendToken&quot;&gt;sendToken(Receiver, Receiver, Token)&lt;/a&gt; method is called, delays&#10;  the delivery of the specified token to the specified receiver&#10;  according to a service rule.&#10;&#10;  The actor differentiates between two kinds of tokens: time-triggered&#10;  and event-triggered, which is defined by the parameter &lt;i&gt;type&lt;/i&gt; in&#10;  the port which is associated with this communication aspect.&#10;&#10;  When tokens are received they are delivered with a delay given by the&#10;  &lt;i&gt;serviceTime&lt;/i&gt; parameter. If the actor is currently servicing a previous&#10;  event-triggered token when it receives a time-triggered token, the event-triggered&#10;  token is queued again and the time-triggered token is serviced. After the&#10;  time-triggered token is sent, the event-triggered token in the queue is selected&#10;  and delivered after the full &lt;i&gt;serviceTime&lt;/i&gt;. If an event-triggered token arrives&#10;  while another event-triggered token arrives, the new event-triggered token is queued.&#10;  If a time-triggered token is received while another time-triggered token is serviced&#10;  an exception is thrown. Time-triggered messages should have a fixed delay. In a&#10;  time-triggered ethernet implementation an offline calculated schedule ensures that only&#10;  one time-triggered message is received by the TTESwitch at a time.&#10;  Event-triggered tokens are processed in FIFO order.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;.  </description>
