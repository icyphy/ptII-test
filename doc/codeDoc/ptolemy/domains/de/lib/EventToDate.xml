  <description>
A timed actor that outputs a date token that corresponds to the current&#10;  model time (maintained by the local clock in the director).&#10;   Such a correspondence is only given in models that synchronize to real time.&#10;  In such models, the real time (date) when the model starts is recorded. An input&#10;  to this actor is compared to the model start time (in model time). The difference between&#10;  those dates (in millisecond resolution) is divided by the time resolution of&#10;  the local clock, added to the start date of the model and then sent to the output.  </description>
