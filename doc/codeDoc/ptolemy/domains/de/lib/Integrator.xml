  <description>
Output the discrete integral of the input. Inputs are multiplied by the time&#10;  gap from the previous input and accumulated. Output is not generated&#10;   until two inputs have been consumed.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  The output type of this actor is forced to be double.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  In postfire(), if an event is present on the &lt;i&gt;reset&lt;/i&gt; port, this&#10;  actor resets to its initial state, and will not output until two&#10;  subsequent inputs have been consumed.  This is useful if the input signal is&#10;  switched on and off, in which case the time gap between events becomes large&#10;  and would otherwise effect the value of the integral.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  The integrator performs linear interpolation between input events,&#10;  where the output of the integrator follows the equation&#10;  y[n] = y[n-1] + (x[n-1] + x[n])*dt/2 where &lt;i&gt;dt&lt;/i&gt; is the time&#10;  differential between events. This equates to the trapezoidal method of&#10;  approximating a Riemann integral.  </description>
