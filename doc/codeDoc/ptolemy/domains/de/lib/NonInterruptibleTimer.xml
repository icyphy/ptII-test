  <description>
A NonInterruptibleTimer actor works similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../ptolemy/domains/de/lib/Timer.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.domains.de.lib.Timer&lt;/a&gt; actor,&#10; except that if a NonInterruptibleTimer actor has not finished processing&#10; the previous input, a new input has to be delayed for processing.&#10; In other words, it can not be interrupted to respond new inputs. Instead,&#10; the new inputs will be queued and processed in a first come first serve&#10; (FCFS) fashion. This actor extends the Timer actor.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The key difference between the NonInterruptibleTimer actor and the Server&#10; actor is how the service time is specified.  In the NonInterruptibleTimer&#10; actor, whenever an input arrives, the value of the input token specifies&#10; the service time.  This actor will guarantee that much service time to be&#10; given to that input.  In the Server actor, service times for inputs ar&#10; decided by the ServiceTime parameter, which may change any time during an&#10; execution. In particular, how much service time an input actually gets is&#10; decided the value of the ServiceTime parameter at the time the server is&#10; ready to serve that input.  </description>
