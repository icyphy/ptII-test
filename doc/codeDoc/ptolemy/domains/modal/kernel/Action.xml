  <description>
An Action is contained by a Transition in an FSMActor or an Event in an&#10; ERGController.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; When the FSMActor is fired, an enabled transition among the outgoing&#10; transitions of the current state is chosen. The choice actions&#10; contained by the chosen transition are executed. An action is a choice&#10; action if it implements the ChoiceAction marker interface. A choice&#10; action may be executed more than once during an iteration in domains&#10; with fixed-point semantics.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; When the FSMActor is postfired, the chosen transition of the latest firing&#10; of the actor is committed. The commit actions contained by the transition&#10; are executed and the current state of the actor is set to the destination&#10; state of the transition. An action is a commit action if it implements the&#10; CommitAction marker interface.  </description>
