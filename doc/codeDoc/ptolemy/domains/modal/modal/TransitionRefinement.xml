  <description>
Transition refinements provide a way to use composite actors which are run&#10; whenever a transition is taken in an FSM modal, much in the same way&#10; that State refinements are run every time an FSM is in a particular state.&#10; This provides an alternative mechanism for performing calculations during&#10; a Transition other than expressions in the Set Actions and Output Actions&#10; of that Transition. The expression actions are still executed but only&#10; after the Transition refinement has been fired.&lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; This typed composite actor supports mirroring of its ports in its&#10; container (which is required to be a ModalModel), which in turn assures&#10; mirroring of ports in each of the refinements and the controller.&#10; TransitionRefinement fulfills the CTStepSizeControlActor interface so that&#10; it can be used to construct hybrid systems using the CT domain.&lt;p&gt;  </description>
