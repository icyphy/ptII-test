  <description>
A port for refinements in modal models that are themselves modal models.  This port&#10; mirrors certain changes to it in the ports of the container of the container and&#10; in the ports of the controller and refinements of the modal model that contains it.&#10; It is designed to work closely with RefinementPort and ModalPort, since changes to the&#10; ports can be initiated in either class.  </description>
