  <description>
This port is used in a channel to mediate type constraints between&#10; senders and receivers on a wireless channel. The way it works is by&#10; pretending that it receives data from the sender and sends data to&#10; the receiver. It does not actually get involved in the transmission&#10; of data (that is handled by the transmit() method of the channel).&#10; This port is always both an input and an output.  This port is not&#10; persistent and is always hidden in a user interface.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; NOTE: Someday, perhaps&#10; this port will be augmented to mediate the communication and&#10; facilitate the construction of channel models as composite&#10; actors instead of atomic actors).  </description>
