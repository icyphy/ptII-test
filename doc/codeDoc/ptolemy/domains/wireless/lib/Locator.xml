  <description>
This is a wireless sensor node that reacts to an input event by&#10; transmitting an output with the current location of this node and&#10; the time of the input.  The output is a record token with type&#10; {location={double}, time=double}.  The location is an array with&#10; two doubles representing the X and Y positions of the sensor.&#10; The location of the sensor is determined by the _getLocation()&#10; protected method, which in this base class returns the location&#10; of the icon in the visual editor, which is determined from the&#10; _location attribute of the actor.  If there is no _location&#10; attribute, then an exception is thrown.  Derived classes may&#10; override this protected method to specify the location in some&#10; other way (or in more dimensions).  </description>
