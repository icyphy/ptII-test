  <description>
This actor retrieves the properties most recently received by&#10; an input port that is connected on the inside to the trigger&#10; port of this actor. That port&#10; must be an instance of WirelessIOPort, and must be contained&#10; by the container of this actor, or an exception will be thrown.&#10; A typical usage pattern is inside an instance of WirelessComposite,&#10; to connect the trigger input to the port from which you want to read&#10; the properties.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; NOTE: The type of the properties port is inferred from the&#10; &lt;i&gt;defaultProperties&lt;/i&gt; field of the channel used by the connected&#10; port at preinitialize() time. If the connection is changed during&#10; execution, or the connectivity is changed, then the type of the&#10; port will not be updated, and a run-time type error could occur.&#10; Thus, this actor assumes that these types do not change.&#10; If the channel has no default properties (as in the base class&#10; AtomicWirelessChannel), then the type of the properties port will&#10; be undefined. If the output is left disconnected, then this is fine,&#10; but if it is connected, then its type will need to be declared&#10; explicitly.  </description>
