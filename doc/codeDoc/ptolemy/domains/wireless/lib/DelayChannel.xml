  <description>
Model of a wireless channel with a specified propagation speed and&#10; loss probability. The propagation speed introduces delay that depends&#10; on the distance between the transmitter and receiver at the time&#10; that the transmitter initiates the communication. This channel model&#10; assumes that the duration of the message is (effectively) zero, so&#10; that neither the transmitter nor the receiver move during the&#10; transmission. It also assumes that the receiver does not move during&#10; propagation. I.e., it assumes that the propagation of the message is&#10; much faster than the node movement.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; A speed equal to Infinity (the default) results in no&#10; propagation delay. If the loss probability is greater than zero then on each&#10; call to the transmit() method, for each receiver in range,&#10; with the specified probability, the transmission to that&#10; receiver will not occur.  Whether a transmission occurs to a particular&#10; receiver is independent of whether it occurs to any other receiver.  </description>

    <property name="propagationSpeed">The propagation speed. This determines the delay between&#10;  transmission and reception.  This is a double that defaults&#10;  to Infinity, which means that there is no delay.</property>
