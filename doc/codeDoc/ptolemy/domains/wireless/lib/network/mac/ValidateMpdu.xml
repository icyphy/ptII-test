  <description>
ValidateMpdu class checks the status field of the RxEnd message. If it indicates&#10; no error, the received data is forwarded to FilterMpdu process. Otherwise,&#10; the data is dropped and ChannelState process will be notified of using EIFS&#10; as IFS (interframe space). In the case of correctly received data, this class&#10; also check its data type. If it is a RTS packet, a timer is set. The duration&#10; is set to be the time needed to receive a CTS, plus some guard time. If no CTS&#10; is received before this timer expires, a RTSTimeout signal is sent to ChannelState&#10; process, which will clear the channel reservation made earlier by the above&#10; RTS packet.  </description>
