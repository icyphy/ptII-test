  <description>
This actor does the back off after a frame transmission. It randomly&#10; choose a slot from the back off window and wait for that amount of&#10; time before trying to access the medium.  </description>

    <property name="seed">The seed that controls the random number generation.&#10;  A seed of zero is interpreted to mean that no seed is specified,&#10;  which means that each execution of the model could result in&#10;  distinct data. For the value 0, the seed is set to&#10;  System.currentTimeMillis() + hashCode(), which means that&#10;  with extremely high probability, two distinct actors will have&#10;  distinct seeds.  However, current time may not have enough&#10;  resolution to ensure that two subsequent executions of the&#10;  same model have distinct seeds.&#10;&#10;  This parameter contains a LongToken, initially with value 0.</property>
