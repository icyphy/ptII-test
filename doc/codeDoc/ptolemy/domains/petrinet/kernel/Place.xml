A Petri net place compatible with the PetriNetDirector. A Petri net&#10; place is a basic component of the Petri Net model. Another basic&#10; component is the Transition. A place is connected to transitions. It&#10; contains an integer as the marking of the place, which represents&#10; the number of tokens in the place. The operation of the Petri net is&#10; controlled by the marking and the weights of arcs connecting places&#10; and transitions.&#10;&#10; The methods here are used to manipulate the integer marking.&#10; The TemporaryMarking is used for checking whether a transition&#10; is ready or not.  </description>
