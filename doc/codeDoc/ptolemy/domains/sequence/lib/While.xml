  <description>
&lt;p&gt;A While actor for the sequence domain.&#10; In an iteration, if an input token is available at the &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; input,&#10; that token is read.&#10; The &lt;i&gt;Then&lt;/i&gt; output is set to true, if then &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; input is true.&#10; The &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; port may only receive Tokens of type Boolean. The output&#10; ports are also of type boolean.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; While is a ControlActor, meaning that it keeps a list of&#10; enabled output ports.&#10; The sequence and process director will keep scheduling the While actor&#10; until its input condition becomes false. Care must be taken when&#10; using this actor, since it can potentially cause an infinite loop in&#10; a model's execution.  </description>
