This actor is used with the Surge TinyOS application to visualize&#10; links between nodes in a multihop network.  In Surge, there are two&#10; types of packets transmitted.  The first type is a beacon message sent&#10; from the base station.  The second type is a Surge message, which originates&#10; from a sensing node and contains sensor data.  The beginning of the packet&#10; format is as follows:&#10;&#10; bits  1-16: address field&#10; bits 17-24: type field&#10;&#10; The address field is set to 0xFFFF if it is a broadcast message.  Otherwise,&#10; it contains the destination node id.&#10;&#10; The type field is set to 0xFA if it is a beacon message (implemented in&#10; TinyOS as MultiHopMsg).  Beacon messages are sent with address field set&#10; to 0xFFFF.  The type field is set to 0x11 if it is a Surge message.&#10;&#10; FIXME: Surge doesn't correctly set the type field for Surge messages.&#10; The value that we see is 0x00, so we filter for this instead.&#10;&#10; This actor extends LinkVisualizer and by inheritance, implements the&#10; ChannelListener interface.  It inspects the token transmitted,&#10; and based on the data, may create a line between&#10; two communicating nodes that are within range of one&#10; another. It registers itself with the wireless channel&#10; specified by the &lt;i&gt;channelName&lt;/i&gt; parameter.  </description>
