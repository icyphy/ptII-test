  <description>
An optional base class for DDE actors. DDEActors are intended to&#10; execute as autonomous processes that maintain a distributed notion&#10; of time. In a DDE model, each actor is controlled by a unique&#10; DDEThread. Each DDEThread maintains its actor's local notion of&#10; time. Local time information is dependent on the time stamps&#10; associated with tokens that are consumed by an actor. More&#10; precisely, an actor's local notion of time is equivalent to the&#10; maximum time stamp of all tokens that the actor has consumed.&#10; Constraints on the consumption of tokens are described in the&#10; documentation for DDEThread. Note that consumed tokens may include&#10; NullTokens. A NullToken is a subclass of Token that is communicated&#10; solely for the purpose of advancing the local notion of time of the&#10; actor that consumes the NullToken.&#10; &lt;P&gt;&#10; The DDE model of computation supports typed, polymorphic actors and&#10; does not require this base class for implementation; this class is&#10; purely optional. This class provides convenient syntactic shortcuts&#10; for developing actors that operate according to DDE semantics.  </description>
