  <description>
The CachedSDFScheduler extends the SDFScheduler by caching schedules.&#10; The cached schedules are labeled by their corresponding rate signatures,&#10; with the most recently used at the beginning of the cache queue. If the&#10; rate signatures are contained in the cache keys, then the corresponding&#10; schedule in the cache is used. Therefore, we do not need to recompute the&#10; schedule again.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The size of the cache in the CachedSDFScheduler is usually set by its&#10; containing director when constructing this scheduler. If the cache is&#10; full, the least recently used schedule (at the end of the cache) is&#10; discarded.  </description>
