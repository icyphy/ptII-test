  <description>
Display an image on the screen using the ptolemy.media.Picture&#10; class.  For a sequence of images that are all the same size, this&#10; class will continually update the picture with new data.  If the&#10; size of the input image changes, then a new Picture object is&#10; created.  This class will only accept a IntMatrixToken on its&#10; input, and assumes that the input image contains greyscale pixel&#10; intensities between 0 and 255 (inclusive).  The token is&#10; read in postfire().&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;Note that this actor really should be replaced by a conversion&#10; actor that converts IntMatrixTokens to ImageTokens.  However,&#10; there is no easy way to do that without accessing the graphical&#10; context of the actor.  An alternative would be to use the&#10; Java Advanced Imaging package and create an actor like&#10; $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/jai/DoubleMatrixToJAI.java.  </description>
