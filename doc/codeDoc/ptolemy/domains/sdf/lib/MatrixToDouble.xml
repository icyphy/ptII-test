  <description>
This actor converts a matrix input sequence of output tokens.&#10; The input must be a DoubleMatrixToken and the output will be a sequence&#10; of instances of DoubleToken.  The number of outputs produced&#10; on each firing is the number of elements in the matrix.&#10; This is assumed to equal the product &lt;i&gt;rows&lt;/i&gt; times &lt;i&gt;columns&lt;/i&gt;,&#10; although this is not enforced unless the actor is under the control&#10; of an instance of SDFDirector.  The SDF director requires this information&#10; to construct its schedule. The first row is produced first, then&#10; the second row, then the third, etc.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;Note that this actor is not likely to work in the CT domain, use&#10; actor.lib.VectorDisassembler instead.  </description>
