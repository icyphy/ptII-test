  <description>
Record an initial token and then output that initial token during&#10; initialize(), then pass through.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The BootstrapSampleDelay works in the same way as a regular&#10; sample delay actor, but with the added feature that it records the&#10; initial value passed into it and will send that value out as the&#10; initial value on the next run.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;Frequently, sample delays are placed as dependency loop-breakers&#10; so that a model can run, but their default value of {0} is&#10; undesirable. This is commonly fixed by examining the first value&#10; passed into the sample delay and either setting the sample delay's&#10; starting value to this value; or recording that value in a&#10; parameter within the same container as the sample delay and setting&#10; the sample delay's starting value to reference the parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The Bootstrap sample delay internalizes the above solutions and&#10; furthermore needs no additional manual upkeep should starting&#10; values change.  </description>
