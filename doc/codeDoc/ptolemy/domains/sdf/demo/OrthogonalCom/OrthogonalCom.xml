  <description>
An binary, orthogonal communication system. Randomly choose a bit,&#10;send the signal associated with the bit, add Gaussian noise to&#10;the signal, and attempt to recover the bit using the maximum&#10;likelihood decision rule. The difference between the send and output&#10;bit is output on the screen. (0 = no error; 1,-1 = error).&#10;&#10;This class is used as a demonstration of the codegen facility, which is&#10;why it is written in Java instead of using MoML.  </description>
