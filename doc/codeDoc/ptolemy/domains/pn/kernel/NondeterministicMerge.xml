  <description>
This actor takes any number of input streams and merges them&#10; nondeterministically.  This actor is intended for use in the&#10; PN domain. It is a composite actor that&#10; creates its own contents.  It contains an instance of PNDirector and one&#10; actor for each input channel (it creates these actors automatically&#10; when a connection is created to the input multiport).  The contained&#10; actors are special actors (implemented as an instance of an inner class)&#10; that read from the port of this actor and write to the port of&#10; this actor. They have no ports of their own.  The lifecycle of the&#10; contained actors (when they are started or stopped) is handled by&#10; the PNDirector in the usual way.  </description>
