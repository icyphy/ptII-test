This object implements a thread that obtains read permission to&#10; a workspace three times sequentially, then calls workspace.wait(obj) on an&#10; object and exits. The object &quot;obj&quot; on which the wait method is called is an&#10; inner class of TestWorkspace2 and has a thread of its own. This thread gets a&#10; write access on the workspace, after the TestWorkspace2 object calls wait(obj)&#10; on it. Then it gives up the write access and returns.&#10; To use it, create an instance and then call its start() method.&#10; To obtain a profile of what it did, call its profile() method.&#10; That will return only after the thread completes.&#10; NOTE: This is a very primitive test.  It does not check very much.  </description>
