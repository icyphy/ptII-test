This actor merges two monotonically nondecreasing streams of tokens&#10; into one monotonically nondecreasing stream. On each firing, it reads&#10; data from one of the inputs. On the first firing, it simply records&#10; that token. On the second firing, it reads data from the other input&#10; and outputs the smaller of the recorded token and the one it just read.&#10; If they are equal, then it outputs the recorded token. It then records&#10; the larger token. On each subsequent firing, it reads a token from the&#10; input port that did not provide the recorded token, and produces at the&#10; output the smaller of the recorded token and the one just read.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; If both input sequences are nondecreasing, then the output sequence&#10; will be nondecreasing.&#10; Note that if the inputs are not nondecreasing, then the output is&#10; rather complex. The key is that in each firing, it produces the smaller&#10; of the recorded token and the token it is currently reading.&#10; This derived class only updates rate parameters to indicate the next input&#10; port.  </description>
