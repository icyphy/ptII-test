  <description>
This actor performs actor recursion dynamically during execution.&#10; Upon firing, it clones the composite actor which contains itself and&#10; is referred to by the StringParameter &lt;i&gt;recursionActor&lt;/i&gt;. It then&#10; places the clone inside itself and connects the corresponding ports of&#10; both actors. It uses a local DDFDirector to preinitialize the clone and&#10; then transfers all tokens contained by input ports of this actor to the&#10; connected opaque ports inside. It again uses the local DDFDirector to&#10; initialize all actors contained by this actor and classifies each of them&#10; such as their enabling and deferrable status. It then transfers all&#10; tokens contained by output ports of this actor to the connected opaque&#10; ports outside. It finally merges the local DDFDirector with its executive&#10; DDFDirector and then removes the local DDFDirector. Thus during execution&#10; this actor is fired at most once, after which the executive director&#10; directly controls all actors inside. Since there is no type constraint&#10; between input ports and output ports of this actor, users have to&#10; manually configure types for all outputs of this actor.  </description>
