  <description>
This is a base class for actors that are intended to be used with an&#10; instance of GiottoCEmachineFrameworkGenerator, an attribute that is&#10; placed in the model and that generates code when the user double clicks on&#10; its icon. This class provides a parameter &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; that is&#10; used to identify the C source file that provides the functionality&#10; of the actor. The&#10; .c file along with the generated code  can then be compiled with emachine&#10; files for a specific platform to generate an executable that runs on&#10; that platform. This actor also has a second parameter&#10; &lt;i&gt;frequency&lt;/i&gt; that is Giotto specific, and is used to specify the number of&#10; times the C task associated with this class is executed in a Giotto&#10; iteration (a &quot;super iteration&quot; in Giotto). It works in conjunction&#10; with the CActor MoML class, which&#10; attaches a tableau factory so that look inside will open the C source&#10; file.  </description>
