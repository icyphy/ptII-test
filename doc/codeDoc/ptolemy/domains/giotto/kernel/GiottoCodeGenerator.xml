  <description>
This attribute is a visible attribute that when configured (by double&#10; clicking on it or by invoking Configure in the context menu) it generates&#10; Giotto code and displays it a text editor.  It is up to the user to save&#10; the Giotto code in an appropriate file, if necessary.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The Giotto Code Generator has been changed from the earlier generator&#10; implemented by Haiyang and Steve in the following respect :-&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;Any and all unconnected ports are ignored. This includes :&#10; &lt;ol&gt;&#10; &lt;li&gt; Removal of its mention in the output drivers&#10; &lt;li&gt; Removal of its mention in task (...) output (...)&#10; &lt;li&gt; Removal of driver code for tasks without inputs&#10; &lt;/ol&gt;  </description>
