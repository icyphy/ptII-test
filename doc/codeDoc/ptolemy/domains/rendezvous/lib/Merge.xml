  <description>
This actor merges any number of input sequences onto one output&#10; sequence. It begins by being willing to rendezvous with any input.&#10; When it receives an input, it then becomes willing to rendezvous&#10; with the output. After successfully delivering the input token&#10; to the output, it returns again to being willing to rendezvous&#10; with any input.&#10; This actor is designed for use in the rendezvous domain, where it will&#10; execute in its own thread.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The behavior of this actor is similar to that of the ResourcePool&#10; actor, except that the ResourcePool actor does buffering.&#10; That is, the ResourcePool is always ready to rendezvous with&#10; any input, while this actor is ready to rendezvous with an&#10; input only after it has delivered the previous input token to&#10; the output.  </description>
