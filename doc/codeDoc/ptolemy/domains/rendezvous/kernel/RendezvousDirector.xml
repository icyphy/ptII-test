  <description>
This director executes actors in their own threads&#10; and provides a receiver that implements rendezvous communication.&#10; The threads are created in the initialize()&#10; method and started in the prefire() method.  After the thread for an actor&#10; is started it is &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt; until the thread finishes. While the&#10; thread is active, it can also be &lt;i&gt;blocked&lt;/i&gt;.&#10; A thread is blocked if it is trying to communicate but&#10; the thread with which it is trying to communicate is not&#10; ready to do so yet. A deadlock occurs when all threads are&#10; blocked. If this director is used at the top level,&#10; the model stops executing when a deadlock occurs.&#10; This director is based on the CSPDirector by&#10; Neil Smyth, Mudit Goel, and John S. Davis II.  </description>
