  <description>
A task in the taskpt domain. It consumes all input tokens at the&#10; beginning and produces all output tokens at the end.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;Input and output tokens are not passed directly, but via pointers that point to&#10; an address (range) in a shared memory that is controlled by the director&#10; of the container of a task. That's why a task has input/output ports for&#10; specifying the outputs. The token on the outside of this port specifies&#10; the address, where the tokens have to be stored in the shared memory. The&#10; inside of this port receives the tokens to be stored. A task&#10; works on copies of the data read from memory. A&#10; TaskDirector takes care of transferring the outputs and inputs. The TaskDirector&#10; also provides a shared memory that is exclusive to all actors within this task.&#10; This ensures that a task is free of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
