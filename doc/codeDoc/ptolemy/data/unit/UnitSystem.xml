  <description>
&lt;p&gt;A unit system as defined by a set of base and derived units.&lt;/p&gt;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The various measurement units of a unit system are represented by the&#10; parameters of an instance of UnitSystem.&#10; The units belong to a number of categories, such as length and time&#10; in the International System of Units (SI). Each category has a base unit,&#10; for example meter in the length category.&lt;/p&gt;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Several basic unit systems are provided with Ptolemy II. They are specified&#10; using MoML. Customized unit systems can be created following these examples.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;  </description>
