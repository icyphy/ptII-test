  <description>
This is an attribute used by the OntologySolver to issue MoML requests and&#10;  make changes to the model. These changes include addition, update, or deletion&#10;  of concept annotations and display of the concept results.&#10;  This is designed to be contained by an instance of OntologySolver&#10;  or a subclass of OntologySolver. It contains parameters that allow&#10;  users to configure the display of the concept annotation results.  </description>
