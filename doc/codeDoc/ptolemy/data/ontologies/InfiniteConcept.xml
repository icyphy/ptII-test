  <description>
A concept that is not part of a finite ontology.&#10;  This class represents Concepts that, rather than being drawn from&#10;  a fixed finite set of the elements in a ConceptGraph, are drawn&#10;  from a potentially infinite set, such as those used to represent&#10;  structured datatypes like records, concepts parameterized over values,&#10;  and other situations where enumerating all possible concepts beforehand&#10;  is not feasible.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  Since this class aims to be a general superclass of any type of infinite&#10;  concept, it does not provide any implementations that may be particular&#10;  to a particular style of infinite concepts, and is abstract.&#10;  Subclasses are responsible for determining exactly what type of infinite&#10;  concept they will support.  </description>
