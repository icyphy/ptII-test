  <description>
A concept that represents the monotoncity of an expression.&#10;&#10;  Note that for an arbitrary expression, it will not have a&#10;  monotonicity concept of simply Monotonic, Constant, etc.&#10;  Rather, the expression will have a monotonicity that depends&#10;  on it's free variables.  For example, an expression of the form&#10;  &lt;code&gt;&#10;    (x &amp;lt;= Concept1) ? Bottom :&#10;    (y &amp;lt;= Concept2) ? Top :&#10;    Concept1&#10;  &lt;/code&gt;&#10;  may have a monotonicity that is monotonic with respect to the&#10;  variable x, but antimonotonic with respect to y (and constant&#10;  with respect to all other variables).&#10;&#10;  This class represents exactly such concepts, representing them as&#10;  {x = Monotonic, y = Animonotonic}, in a manner and syntax&#10;  similar to records of the Ptolemy II type system.  In records,&#10;  however, accessing an undefined tag is an error, whereas in&#10;  expressions, they are simply constant with respect to any&#10;  variables that are not free.  </description>
