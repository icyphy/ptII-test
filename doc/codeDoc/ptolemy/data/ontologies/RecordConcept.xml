A concept that represents the concept values of entries in a record token.&#10;&#10;  A conceptable model element such as a port or node in a Ptolemy expression&#10;  could contain a token value that is a record data type.  A record token&#10;  is a token that is a collection of multiple token values of different&#10;  types. For example, we might want to specify a record that indicates the&#10;  (x,y) pixel position on a black-and-white screen, and also true or false&#10;  for whether that pixel position is on or off.  We can use a record of the form:&#10;  {x = 34, y = 26, pixelOn = true}&#10;  &lt;p&gt;&#10;  This RecordConcept allows any record to be assigned concept values for its&#10;  individual elements from an arbitrary finite ontology. For example, if we&#10;  wanted to assign a concept to the token above from the constAbstractInterpretation&#10;  ontology, it would be:&#10;  {x = Positive, y = Positive, pixelOn = BooleanTrue}&#10;&#10;  This code is adapted from the&#10;  &lt;a href=&quot;../../../ptolemy/data/ontologies/lattice/adapters/monotonicityAnalysis/MonotonicityConcept.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.data.ontologies.lattice.adapters.monotonicityAnalysis.MonotonicityConcept&lt;/a&gt;&#10;  implementation.  </description>
