&lt;p&gt;Parameter extends Variable with additional support for string-valued&#10; variables that makes these friendlier at the user interface level.&#10; In particular, this class supports an annotation that specifies&#10; choices for values.  A user interface can use this to present a&#10; choice dialog that offers the specified values.  This is typically&#10; used when a particular set of choices make sense.  The values can&#10; be any expression, or if used in conjunction with string mode,&#10; any string.&lt;/p&gt;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; By default, an instance of Parameter, unlike Variable, is persistent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; By convention, an instance of NamedObj has a set of attributes,&#10; some of which are visible to users and some of which are not.&#10; When a user interface presents these attributes&#10; for editing, it presents only those that are visible.&#10; By default, an instance of Parameter is visible, as indicated by the fact&#10; that it returns FULL in its getVisibility() method.  This can be overridden&#10; by calling setVisibility().&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
