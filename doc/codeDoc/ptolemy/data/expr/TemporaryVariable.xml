This is identical to a Variable except that creating it does not&#10; increment the workspace version. It should be used to create&#10; a variable to store information and make that information visible&#10; to the user, but where the presence of this variable has no bearing&#10; on type resolution, scheduling, model structure, or any other&#10; property of the model that might invalidate cached information.&#10; This variable should be used with caution, but use of this&#10; variable can significantly improve performance since it makes&#10; caching of information that is expensive to compute much more&#10; effective.  </description>
