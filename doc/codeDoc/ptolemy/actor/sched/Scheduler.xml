  <description>
The base class for schedulers. A scheduler schedules the execution&#10; order of the containees of a CompositeActor.  &lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; A scheduler is contained by a StaticSchedulingDirector, and provides&#10; the schedule for it.  The director will use this schedule to govern&#10; the execution of a CompositeActor. &lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; A schedule is represented by the Schedule class, and determines the&#10; order of the firing of the actors in a particular composite actor.  In&#10; this base class, the default schedule fires the deeply&#10; contained actors in the order of their construction.  A domain specific&#10; scheduler will override this to provide a different order. &lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; The schedule, once constructed, is cached and reused as long as the&#10; schedule is still valid.  The validity of the schedule is set by the&#10; setValid() method.  If the current schedule is not valid, then the&#10; schedule will be recomputed the next time the getSchedule() method is&#10; called.  However, derived classes will usually override only the&#10; protected _getSchedule() method. &lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; The scheduler does not perform any mutations, and it does not listen&#10; for changes in the model.  Directors that use this scheduler should&#10; normally invalidate the schedule when mutations occur.  </description>
