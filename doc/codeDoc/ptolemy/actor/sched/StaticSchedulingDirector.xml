  <description>
A director that uses static scheduling to govern the execution of the&#10; CompositeActor it belongs to. &lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; This class does not directly implement a scheduling algorithm, but&#10; defers to its contained scheduler.  The contained scheduler creates an&#10; instance of the Schedule class which determines the number of times&#10; each actor should be fired and their firing order.  This allows new&#10; scheduling algorithms to be easily created for existing domains.&lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; This class is generally useful for statically scheduled domains where&#10; a schedule can be constructed once and used to repeatedly execute the&#10; model.  The Scheduler class caches the schedule until the model changes&#10; so that the schedule does not have to be recomputed.  </description>
