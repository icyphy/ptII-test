  <description>
A tableau is a visual representation of a Ptolemy II model in a top-level&#10; window.  This class represents such a top level window.  The top-level&#10; is always a frame, which is a window with a border and title bar. The&#10; window itself is specified by the setFrame() method, and accessed by&#10; the getFrame() method.  An instance of this class will be contained&#10; by the instance of Effigy that represents the model that is depicted&#10; in the top-level window.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; By convention, the constructor for a tableau does not (necessarily)&#10; make the associated frame visible.  To do that, call show().  </description>
