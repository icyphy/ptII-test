  <description>
A tableau representing a plot in a toplevel window.&#10; The URL that is viewed is given by the &lt;i&gt;uri&lt;/i&gt; parameter, and&#10; can be either an absolute URL, a system fileName, or a resource that&#10; can be loaded relative to the classpath.  For more information about how&#10; the URL is specified, see MoMLApplication.specToURL().&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The plot frame itself must be an instance of PlotTableauFrame,&#10; and must be created by the caller.&#10; As with other tableaux, this is an entity that is contained by&#10; an effigy of a model.&#10; There can be any number of instances of this class in an effigy.  </description>
