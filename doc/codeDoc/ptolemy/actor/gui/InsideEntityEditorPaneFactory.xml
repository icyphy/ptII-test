  <description>
This is an attribute that can create a pane (called a &quot;configuration&#10; widget&quot;) for interactively configuring an entity contained by its container.&#10; That is, it adds a level of indirection, making it appear as if you&#10; were configuring the container, when in fact you are configuring an&#10; entity contained by the container.  If the container is not an instance&#10; of CompositeEntity, or it does not contain any entities, then this behaves&#10; just like the base class.  If the container contains more than one entity,&#10; then only the first one encountered is configured.  To use this,&#10; place an instance of this class (or a derived class) inside a Ptolemy II&#10; object.  When the user double clicks on the icon for that object,&#10; or selects Configure from the context menu, then a dialog is opened&#10; containing the pane returned by createEditorPane().  </description>
