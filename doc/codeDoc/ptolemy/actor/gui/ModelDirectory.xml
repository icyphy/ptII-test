  <description>
A directory of open models. An instance of this class is contained&#10; by a Configuration. Each open model is represented by an instance of&#10; Effigy.  An effigy represents the model data.&#10; It contains a string attribute named &quot;identifier&quot;&#10; with a string value that uniquely identifies the model.&#10; A typical choice (which depend on the configuration)&#10; is the canonical URL for a MoML file that describes the model.&#10; An effigy also contains all open instances of Tableau associated&#10; with the model.  </description>
