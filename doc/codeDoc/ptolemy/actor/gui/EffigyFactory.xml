  <description>
A configuration contains an instance of this class, and uses it to create&#10; effigies from a URL, or to create blank effigies of a particular kind.&#10; This base class assumes that it contains other effigy factories.&#10; Its createEffigy() methods defer to each contained factory in order&#10; until one is capable of creating an effigy. Subclasses of this class&#10; will usually be inner classes of an Effigy and will create the Effigy,&#10; or they might themselves be aggregates of instances of EffigyFactory.  </description>
