  <description>
A class to do scheduled repaints at certain user specified moments in&#10; the execution of the model. This component piggy-backs with the execution&#10; of its container, and allows you to define that repaints need to happen when&#10; certain functions of its container are executed. Currently only repaints at&#10; wrapup or post-fire can be scheduled.  </description>
