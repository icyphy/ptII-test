  <description>
A tableau representing an external text editor (for now emacs only, with&#10; the gnuserv package installed).&lt;p&gt;&#10;&#10; This is just a demo form. TextEditorTableau should really be made&#10; abstract and have different implementations depending on user&#10; preferences. ExternalTextTableau should not really derive from the java&#10; swing Frame based TextEditorTableau. The interface of the abstract&#10; TextEditorTableau should support both swing JFrame based editor and&#10; external text editor classes.&#10;&#10; Note that one could send signals (events) back to this class for&#10; example if the buffer associated with this &quot;tableau&quot; is deleted or&#10; updated or &quot;Saved As&quot;. This could be achieved by adding special &quot;hooks&quot;&#10; to emacs' file operation hook lists...  </description>
