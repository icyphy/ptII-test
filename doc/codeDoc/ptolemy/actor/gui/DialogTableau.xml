  <description>
A tableau representing a Dialog in a toplevel window.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; DialogTableau is just like all the other XXXTableau classes except that the&#10; Frame associated with DialogTableau is not an extension of TableauFrame, and,&#10; ultimately, the Top class. The reason being that Top adorns the GUI&#10; manifestation with the normal status bar which isn't appropriate for a&#10; dialog.&#10; In addition, the created dialog is not a JDialog, but a JFrame. And, the&#10; created dialog is non-modal.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; There can be any number of instances of this class in an effigy, however,&#10; there&#10; can only be one each for the model represented by the effigy, and one each of&#10; the actors that are part of the model.  </description>
