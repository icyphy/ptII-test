This is an attribute that can create an editor for interactively&#10; configuring its container. If you place an instance of this class&#10; inside a Ptolemy II object, then when a user double clicks on the&#10; object, instead of&#10; the default behavior (which is to edit parameters), the createEditor()&#10; method of this class is called.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This differs from EditorPaneFactory&#10; in that it is responsible for every aspect of creating the editor.&#10; Thus, it has to create a top-level window, rather than just a pane&#10; to insert in a top-level window.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; In this base class, the createEditor() method is abstract.&#10; Derived classes must override this method to present a user&#10; interface for configuring the object.&#10; For example, a digital filter actor could present a filter&#10; design interface.  A plotter actor could present a panel for&#10; configuring a plot.  A file reader actor could present a file&#10; browser.  </description>
