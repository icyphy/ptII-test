  <description>
A parameter to store an integer number priority in an actor. The default&#10; priority is 0. A smaller number designates a higher priority. In an execution&#10; with a timed model of computation, such as DE, when two actors are scheduled&#10; with the same timestamp and microstep, they are fired according to the priority&#10; specified for them. The actor with a smaller priority number is fired before&#10; the one with a greater priority number.  </description>
