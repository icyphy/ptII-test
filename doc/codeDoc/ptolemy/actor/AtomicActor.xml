  <description>
An AtomicActor is an executable entity that cannot itself contain&#10; other actors. The Ports of AtomicActors are constrained to be IOPorts.&#10; Derived classes may further constrain the ports by overriding the public&#10; method newPort() to create a port of the appropriate subclass, and the&#10; protected method _addPort() to throw an exception if its argument is a&#10; port that is not of the appropriate subclass. In this base class, the&#10; actor does nothing in the action methods (prefire, fire, ...).  </description>
