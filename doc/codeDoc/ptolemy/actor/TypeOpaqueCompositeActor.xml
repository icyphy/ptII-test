  <description>
A composite actor whose ports have types, but the actors inside are&#10; not required to be typed. This actor does not impose any type&#10; constraints between its ports, so any output ports of this actor&#10; have to have explicitly declared types. There is no mechanism for&#10; inferring the types of the output ports. Note that the ports of&#10; this actor cannot be linked on the inside to untyped relations, and&#10; by default, any relation created on the inside will be untyped.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt; The intended use of this actor is for scenarios where the&#10; inside structure is not part of the Ptolemy type system. For&#10; example, the inside structure may define a component that will be&#10; translated into executable code by a code generator. A subclass of&#10; this actor would typically include the code generator an a&#10; mechanism for executing the generating code.  </description>
