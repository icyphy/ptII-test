  <description>
This actor generates discrete events by sampling the input signal whenever&#10; the &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; input is present.&#10; This sampler will send to the output whatever input occurs&#10; at a sample time; if the input is absent, the output will be&#10; absent.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor has multiport inputs and outputs. Signals in&#10; each input channel are sampled and produced to corresponding output&#10; channel. When there are multiple inputs, the first non-absent input&#10; from each channel is read, and the output is produced at the first&#10; microstep after the last of the inputs became non-absent.  </description>
