  <description>
This actor, which has no ports, delays the execution of the model&#10; until a specified time by sleeping the thread that calls the&#10; initialize() method until the specified time. If the time is&#10; in the past, then there is no delay. The time is assumed to be&#10; today, and is given as in &quot;1:00 pm&quot; for one in the afternoon.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; If this actor is used in SDF, then the director must be set&#10; to allow disconnected graphs.  Note that it makes no sense&#10; to use this actor in PN or CSP, since it will only delay the&#10; start of its own thread.  </description>
