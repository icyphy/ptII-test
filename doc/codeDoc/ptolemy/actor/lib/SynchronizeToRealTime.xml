Attribute that regulates the passage of time to wait for real time to catch up.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The scaleFactor parameter is here to set up how many seconds in wallclock&#10; time should pass for a single second in model time. So a scale factor of 0.5&#10; will make the model time passes twice as fast as real time, while make it&#10; equals 2 means that 2 seconds in wallclock are needed for a single unit&#10; of time in the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The default value is 1.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
