  <description>
Produce an output token on each firing with a value that is&#10; the current time. The output is of type double.&#10; By default, this uses the local notion of time, which may&#10; lag behind the global notion of time if this actor is used&#10; inside a modal model. Under the Continuous director, it is&#10; essential to use local time, and not global time&#10; because of the speculative executions during numerical&#10; ODE solving.  </description>

    <property name="useLocalTime">If true, use the model time reported by the input port,&#10;  which is normally the model time of the local director.&#10;  If false (the default), use the model time reported by&#10;  the top-level director. Local time may differ&#10;  from global time inside modal models and certain domains&#10;  that manipulate time.</property>
