  <description>
A simple sink actor that consumes and discards input tokens.&#10; &lt;p&gt;This actor is useful in situations where the value of an output is not&#10; needed, but for some reason, the output cannot be left unconnected.&#10; Also, when manipulating bus signals, this actor is useful if values&#10; in the middle of the bus need to be discarded.  Leaving the bus&#10; unconnected in the middle will not work because no channel is allocated&#10; to an unconnected relation in a bus.  </description>
