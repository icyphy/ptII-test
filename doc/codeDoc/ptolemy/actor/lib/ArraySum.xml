  <description>
Compute the sum of the elements in an array.  This actor reads an&#10; array from the &lt;i&gt;input&lt;/i&gt; port and sends the sum of its elements&#10; to the &lt;i&gt;output&lt;/i&gt; port. The output data type is at least the&#10; type of the elements of the input array.  The elements of the input&#10; array have to support addition, or an&#10; exception will be thrown in the fire() method.&#10; This actor is similar to ArrayAverage, except that it supports&#10; data types that do not support division by an integer.  </description>
