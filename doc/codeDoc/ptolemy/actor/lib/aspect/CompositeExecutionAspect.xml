  <description>
This is a composite execution aspect. Actors decorated by this&#10;  aspect also specify a &lt;i&gt;requestPort&lt;/i&gt;. A record&#10;  token with the actor and its execution time is&#10;  created on this requestPort whenever the director wants to schedule&#10;  the actor. When this token is received by a ResourceMappingOutputport&#10;  inside this CompositeExecutionAspect, the director is informed&#10;  that the actor can now fire.  </description>
