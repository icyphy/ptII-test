  <description>
This actor copies, to the system clipboard, the contents of any token&#10; received at its &lt;i&gt;input&lt;/i&gt; port.  It pastes, from the system&#10; clipboard to the &lt;i&gt;output&lt;/i&gt; port, whenever it receives a token at&#10; the &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt;.  If both inputs receive tokens during the same&#10; firing, the paste is done before the copy.  This ordering insures that&#10; the contents of the clipboard are not lost in the event of a&#10; simultaneous copy-paste operation.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt; NOTE: This actor has been tested only with an 8-bit character set&#10; as the Java default character set.  Results are not known for systems&#10; configured for 16-bit Unicode characters.  </description>
