  <description>
&lt;p&gt;On each firing, read at most one token from each input channel, sleep&#10; by the specified amount of real time, and then produce the same input&#10; tokens on the respective output channels. This actor calls Thread.sleep()&#10; in the fire() method, so the thread that calls fire() will be suspended.&#10; If fire() is called multiple times in one iteration, sleep is only called&#10; the first time.&#10; If the width of the output port is less than that of the input port,&#10; the tokens in the extra channels are lost.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#10; The effect of this actor is different in different domains.&#10; In domains where all actors are iterated from within a single director&#10; thread (like SDF and DE), then multiple instances of this actor will&#10; result in cumulative time delays. That is, the time taken by an iteration&#10; of the model will be greater than the sum of the sleep times of all the&#10; instances. In domains where actors execute in their own thread (like PN&#10; and CSP), only the execution of the individual actor is slowed.&#10; Note that another way to slow down the execution of a model while running&#10; inside vergil is to turn on animation.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
