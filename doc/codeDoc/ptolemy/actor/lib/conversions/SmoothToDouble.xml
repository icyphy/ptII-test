  <description>
Convert a &lt;a href=&quot;../../../../ptolemy/data/SmoothToken.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.data.SmoothToken&lt;/a&gt; (one that has a double value and an array of&#10; derivatives) to a DoubleToken, discarding the derivative information.&#10; Normally, such a conversion is not necessary&#10; because any actor that can accept a DoubleToken can also transparently&#10; accept a SmoothToken. However, when an input port receives a SmoothToken,&#10; the port becomes &lt;i&gt;persistent&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that it will always have a token.&#10; If an actor reads from this input port at a time when no SmoothToken has arrived,&#10; then the most recently received SmoothToken will be extrapolated, using its&#10; derivative information, to obtain a value at that time. If you wish for a&#10; downstream port to not be persistent, then you can use this actor to convert&#10; the signal.  Downstream input ports will be absent at all times except those&#10; when an actual token is sent.  </description>
