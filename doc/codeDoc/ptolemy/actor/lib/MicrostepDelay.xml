  <description>
This actor delays the input by one microstep. The output is always&#10; absent in the first firing. This actor is designed&#10; to be used in domains where the director implements&#10; SuperdenseTimeDirector, like Continuous and DE.&#10; Inputs are read only during the postfire() method.&#10; If an input is present, then this actor schedules itself to fire again&#10; to produce the just received token on the corresponding output channel in&#10; the next microstep at the same time stamp.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; When this actor is used in the Continuous domain, it requires that its&#10; input be purely  discrete (specifically that it be absent at microstep 0).&#10; The reason for rejecting continuous inputs is that a continuous input&#10; would cause a stuttering Zeno condition, where time cannot advance.  </description>
