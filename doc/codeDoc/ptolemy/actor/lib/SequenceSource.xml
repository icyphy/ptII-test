  <description>
Base class for sequence sources.  A sequence source is&#10; a source where the output value is logically a sequence, independent&#10; of time, but dependent on the iteration number.  For some time-based&#10; domains, such as CT, actors of this type probably do not make sense&#10; because the number of iterations that the actor experiences per unit&#10; time is not easily determined or controlled.  This actor has a parameter,&#10; &lt;i&gt;firingCountLimit&lt;/i&gt;, that optionally limits the number of iterations&#10; for which the actor is fired.  If this number is &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0, then&#10; the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-th invocation of postfire() returns false, which ggindicates&#10; to the scheduler that it should stop invocations of this actor.&#10; The default value of &lt;i&gt;firingCountLimit&lt;/i&gt;&#10; is NONE, which results in postfire always returning&#10; true.  Derived classes must call super.postfire() for this mechanism to&#10; work.  </description>
