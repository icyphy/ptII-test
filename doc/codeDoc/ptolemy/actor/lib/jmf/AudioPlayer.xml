  <description>
This actor accepts an ObjectToken that contains a DataSource.&#10; This is typically obtained from the output of the StreamLoader&#10; actor.  This actor will play Datasources containing a MP3, MIDI, and&#10; CD Audio file.  After the model is run, a window will pop up&#10; allowing control of playing, rate of playback, and volume control.  </description>
