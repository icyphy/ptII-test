  <description>
On each firing, output true if the input is present and false otherwise.&#10; The type of the output port is boolean, and the input is general.&#10; The width of the input is expected to match the width of the output.&#10; Note that the utility of this actor varies by domain.  In PN, for&#10; example, the input is always present (by definition). In SDF, it is&#10; expected to be always present, but may not be.  In DE, the actor is&#10; only triggered if one of the input channels has data.  The actor is&#10; probably most useful in synchronous domains like SR and Giotto.  </description>
