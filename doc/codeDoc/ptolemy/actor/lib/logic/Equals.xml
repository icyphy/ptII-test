  <description>
A logical equals operator.  This operator has one input&#10; multiport and one output port that is not a multiport. It will consume&#10; at most one token from each input channel, and compare the tokens&#10; using the isEqualTo() method of the Token class.  If all observed&#10; input tokens are equal, then the output will be a true-valued boolean&#10; token.  If there is not at least one token on the input channels,&#10; then no output is produced.&#10; The type of the input port is undeclared and will be resolved by the type&#10; resolution mechanism.  Note that all input channels must resolve to the&#10; same type.  The type of the output port is boolean.  </description>
