  <description>
Upon firing, this actor outputs the elapsed real time in seconds&#10; since the start time of the model, as reported by the director.&#10; The output type is double.&#10; The resolution of time depends on the implementation of the Java&#10; virtual machine, but with Sun's JDK 1.3 under Windows 2000, it is&#10; 10 milliseconds.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note that relying on the data produced by this actor is tricky&#10; in domains where you do not have precise control over the&#10; scheduling, since the output reflects the wall-clock time at&#10; which this actor is fired, which may or may not be indicative&#10; of the times at which other actors fire.  So that you can get&#10; more control over the schedule, the input provided at the&#10; &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; port is passed through to the &lt;i&gt;passThrough&lt;/i&gt;&#10; output port.  This can be used to ensure that this actor&#10; fires before another downstream actor.  </description>

    <port name="passThrough">The output port to which the &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; input is passed.&#10;  The type is the same as the type of the &lt;i&gt;trigger&lt;/i&gt; port,&#10;  which is undeclared, meaning that it will resolve to any type.</port>
