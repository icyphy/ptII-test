  <description>
This port mirrors the properties of an associated port. That is,&#10; if either this port or the associated port is changed by&#10; setInput(), setOutput(), setMultiport(), or if it is removed&#10; by setContainer(null), or its name is changed by setName(),&#10; then the mirror port gets the same&#10; changes.  The changes are also applied to derived ports&#10; (ports that mirror this one because of the class mechanism).&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Users of this class must override their clone(Workspace)&#10; method to re-establish appropriate port associations in&#10; the clone.  Cloning this port results in a clone with&#10; no associations.  </description>
