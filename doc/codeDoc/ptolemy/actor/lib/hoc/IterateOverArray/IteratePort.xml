  <description>
This is a specialized port for IterateOverArray.&#10;  If the container is an instance of IterateOverArray,&#10;  then it handles type conversions between&#10;  the array types of the ports of the enclosing IterateOverArray&#10;  actor and the scalar types (or arrays with one less dimension)&#10;  of the actor that are contained.  It has a notion of an&#10;  &quot;associated port,&quot; and ensures that changes to the status&#10;  of one port (whether it is input, output, or multiport)&#10;  are reflected in the associated port.  </description>
