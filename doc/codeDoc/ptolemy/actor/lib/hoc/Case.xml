  <description>
An actor that executes one of several refinements depending on the&#10; value provided by the &lt;i&gt;control&lt;/i&gt; port-parameter. To use this,&#10; drag the Case icon onto the canvas, right click and select Open Actor.&#10; To add a refinement, go to the Case menu in the menu bar and select Add Case,&#10; then populate populate the refinement with computations.&#10; Each refinement is a composite that is required to have its own director.&#10; The name of the refinement is value that the control must have to&#10; execute this refinement.&#10; This actor always provides one case called &quot;default&quot;. This is&#10; the refinement that is executed if no other refinement matches&#10; the control input.  All refinements have the same ports,&#10; and adding ports to any one refinement or to the case actor&#10; itself results in identical ports being added to all refinements.  </description>
