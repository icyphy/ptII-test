  <description>
Output the maximum value seen since the start of execution of the model.&#10; On each firing, this actor consumes exactly one scalar token at its input port.&#10; The value of the token is compared to the maximum value maintained since the&#10; start of the execution. The greater of the two is output to the output port in&#10; the same firing, and the maximum value is set with that greater value in&#10; postfire().  </description>
