  <description>
This actor reads tokens from any number of input channels and writes&#10; their string values to the specified writer.  A newline character&#10; is written between firings.  If the width of the input port is greater&#10; than one, then values read from the distinct channels are separated&#10; by tab characters. If no writer is specified using setWriter(), then&#10; this actor writes to the standard output.  </description>
