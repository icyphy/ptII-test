Randomly change values in a double matrix to 0.0 or 255.0.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;This actor reads in a double matrix and then randomly changes&#10; some of the matrix elements to 0.0 or to 255.0.  Some of the elements&#10; remain unchanged.  If the double matrix represents an image, then&#10; the image would appear to have Salt and Pepper scattered on it.  </description>

    <property name="probability">The probability that a pixel will be turned black or white.&#10;  This parameter contains a double between 0.0 and 1.0, the&#10;  initial default value is 0.1.  With the initial default value&#10;  of 0.1, then there is a 5% chance a pixel will be turned&#10;  white, a 5% chance that the pixel will be turned black&#10;  and a 90% chance that the pixel will remain unchanged.</property>
