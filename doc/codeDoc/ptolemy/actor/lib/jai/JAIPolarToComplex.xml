Output a complex image with alternating real and imaginary bands.  This&#10; actor takes two inputs, an image representing the magnitude of the&#10; bands, and an image representing the phase of the bands.  The two&#10; inputs must have the same number of bands.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt; The output of this actor may not be suitable for displaying or saving&#10; because of the increase in the number of bands, as well as the high&#10; resolution of the data (doubles).  </description>

The first two bands correspond to the cartesian&#10;  values of the first magnitude and phase bands.  The second two&#10;  bands correspond to the cartesian values of the second magnitude&#10;  and phase bands, etc.</port>
