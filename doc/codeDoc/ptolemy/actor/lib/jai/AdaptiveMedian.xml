  <description>
This actor performs adaptive median filtering on an image.  The&#10; algorithm is as follows.  For each pixel in the image, a square region&#10; of interest is formed with the pixel at the center.  If said region&#10; can not be formed (because it is at or near the edge).&#10;&#10; If the median of this region of interest is strictly less than the&#10; maximum value in the region of interest and strictly greater than&#10; the minimum value in the region of interest, then we keep the pixel&#10; if it too is strictly less than the maximum value in the region of&#10; interest and strictly greater than the minimum value in the region&#10; of interest.  If it is not, then use the median of the region of&#10; interest instead of the pixel.&#10;&#10; If the pixel is not strictly less than the maximum value and strictly&#10; greater than the minimum value, an attempt is made at using larger&#10; region of interest.  If successful, then this process is repeated until&#10; a value can be determine, or we hit the the maximum window size.  If this&#10; happens, then the pixel is kept.  This process is repeated for each pixel.  </description>
