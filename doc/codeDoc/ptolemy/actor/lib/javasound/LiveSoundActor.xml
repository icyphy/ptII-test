  <description>
This actor forms a base class for actors that interact with real-time&#10; sound through the ptolemy.media.LiveSound class.  This class manages the&#10; parameters for live sound.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note: Requires Java 2 v1.3.0 or later.  </description>

    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="bitsPerSample">The number of bits per sample. This is an integer that&#10;  defaults to 16. This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  An exception will be thrown if this parameter is set to an&#10;  unsupported bit resolution (currently, only 8 and 16 bits&#10;  are supported).</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="bufferSize">The requested buffer size in the audio hardware. This&#10;  affects how far ahead of real time the model can get.&#10;  A larger buffer size may limit the responsivity of the&#10;  model because changes in the model will be heard only&#10;  after the buffer has been flushed. This is an integer&#10;  that defaults to 1024, representing a buffer with&#10;  1024 samples per channel. At an 8 kHz sample rate,&#10;  this means a worst-case latency of about 1/8 seconds.&#10;  This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="channels">The number of audio channels. This is an integer that&#10;  defaults to 1. This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  An exception will be thrown if this parameter is set to an&#10;  an unsupported channel number.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="sampleRate">The sample rate in samples per second. This is an integer that&#10;  defaults to 8000. This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  An exception will be thrown if this parameter is set to an&#10;  unsupported sample rate.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="transferSize">The number of samples that will be transferred to the audio driver&#10;  together.  This is an integer with default 128.&#10;  This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.</property>
