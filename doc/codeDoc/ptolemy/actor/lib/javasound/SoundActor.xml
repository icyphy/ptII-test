  <description>
This actor forms a base class for actors that interact with real-time&#10; sound through sampled data. This replaces an older and more limited&#10; actor LiveSoundActor.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note: Requires Java 5.0.  </description>

    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="bytesPerSample">The number of bytes per sample. This is an integer that&#10;  defaults to 2. This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  An exception will be thrown if this parameter is set to an&#10;  unsupported bit resolution.&#10;  Changing the value of this parameter will have an effect&#10;  only when the model is next initialized.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="bufferSize">The requested buffer size for transferring samples. This&#10;  affects how far ahead of real time the model can get.&#10;  A larger buffer size may limit the responsivity of the&#10;  model because changes in the model will be heard only&#10;  after the buffer has been flushed. This is an integer&#10;  that defaults to 1024, representing a buffer with&#10;  1024 samples per channel. At an 8 kHz sample rate,&#10;  this means a worst-case latency of about 1/8 seconds.&#10;  This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  Changing the value of this parameter will have an effect&#10;  only when the model is next initialized.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="channels">The number of audio channels. This is an integer that&#10;  defaults to 1. This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  An exception will be thrown if this parameter is set to an&#10;  an unsupported channel number.&#10;  Changing the value of this parameter will have an effect&#10;  only when the model is next initialized.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.actor.parameters.SharedParameter-->
    <property name="sampleRate">The sample rate in samples per second. This is an integer that&#10;  defaults to 8000. This parameter is shared by all instances&#10;  of this class and subclasses in the model, so changing it in&#10;  one of those actors will cause it to change in all.&#10;  An exception will be thrown if this parameter is set to an&#10;  unsupported sample rate.&#10;  Changing the value of this parameter will have an effect&#10;  only when the model is next initialized.</property>
