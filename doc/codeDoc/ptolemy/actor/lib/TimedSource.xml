  <description>
Base class for time-based sources.  A time-based source is&#10; a source where the output value is a function of current time.&#10; For some sequence-based domains, such as SDF, actors of this type&#10; probably do not make sense because current time is not incremented.&#10; This actor has a parameter, &lt;i&gt;stopTime&lt;/i&gt;, that optionally controls&#10; the duration for which the actor is fired. When current time reaches&#10; the stopTime, postfire() returns false. This indicates&#10; to the director that this actor should not be invoked again.&#10; The default value of stopTime is &lt;i&gt;Infinity&lt;/i&gt;, which results in postfire&#10; always returning true.  In other words, this makes the lifetime&#10; infinite. Derived classes must call super.postfire() for this mechanism to&#10; work.  </description>

    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="stopTime">The time at which postfire() should return false. This is a&#10;  double that defaults to Infinity, which means that postfire()&#10;  never returns false (or at least, doesn't do so due to stopTime&#10;  having been exceeded).</property>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="stopTimeIsLocal">If true, use the local time to compare against the &lt;i&gt;stopTime&lt;/i&gt;&#10;  parameter, rather than the global time. Local time may differ&#10;  from global time inside modal models and certain domains&#10;  that manipulate time. This is a boolean that defaults&#10;  to false.</property>
