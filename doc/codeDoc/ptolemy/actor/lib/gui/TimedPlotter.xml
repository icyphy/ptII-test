  <description>
A signal plotter.  This plotter contains an instance of the Plot class&#10; from the Ptolemy plot package as a public member.  Data at the input, which&#10; can consist of any number of channels, are plotted on this instance.&#10; Each channel is plotted as a separate data set.&#10; The horizontal axis represents time, which by default is the global&#10; time of the model (the model time of the top-level director).&#10; Setting &lt;i&gt;useLocalTime&lt;/i&gt; to true changes this to use the&#10; local time of the input port, which is (in most domains) the model&#10; time of the local director.  </description>

    <property name="disconnectGraphOnAbsentValue">When disconnectGraphOnAbsentValue is True there will be a gap&#10;  in the graph each time a the actor is fired, but the value&#10;  is absent for a certain channel. Especially in the continuous&#10;  domain this options is useful. By default this parameter is&#10;  False.</property>

    <property name="useLocalTime">If true, use the model time reported by the input port,&#10;  which is normally the model time of the local director.&#10;  If false (the default), use the model time reported by&#10;  the top-level director. Local time may differ&#10;  from global time inside modal models and certain domains&#10;  that manipulate time.</property>
