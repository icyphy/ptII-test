  <description>
This is a specialized input port that subscribes to data sent&#10; to it on the specified named channel.&#10; The tokens are &quot;tunneled&quot; from an instance of&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;../../ptolemy/actor/PublisherPort.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.actor.PublisherPort&lt;/a&gt; that names the same channel.&#10; If &lt;a href=&quot;../../ptolemy/actor/SubscriberPort.xml#global&quot;&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; is false (the default), then this subscriber&#10; will only see instances of PublisherPort that are under the&#10; control of the same director. That is, it can&#10; be at a different level of the hierarchy, or in an entirely different&#10; composite actor, as long as the relevant composite actors are&#10; transparent (have no director). If &lt;a href=&quot;../../ptolemy/actor/SubscriberPort.xml#global&quot;&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; is true,&#10; then the publisher may be anywhere in the model, as long as its&#10; &lt;i&gt;global&lt;/i&gt; parameter is also true.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Any number of instances of SubscriberPort can subscribe to the same&#10; channel.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; This actor actually has a hidden input port that is connected&#10; to the publisher via hidden &quot;liberal links&quot; (links that are&#10; allowed to cross levels of the hierarchy).  Consequently,&#10; any data dependencies that the director might assume on a regular&#10; &quot;wired&quot; connection will also be assumed across Publisher-Subscriber&#10; pairs.  Similarly, type constraints will propagate across&#10; Publisher-Subscriber pairs. That is, the type of the Subscriber&#10; output will match the type of the Publisher input.  </description>
