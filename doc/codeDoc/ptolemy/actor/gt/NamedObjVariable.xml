  <description>
A variable to encapsulate the NamedObj that contains itself. This variable is&#10; automatically generated by the expression evaluator when a name resolves to a&#10; NamedObj which is not a variable. In that case, one such variable is generated&#10; in the resolved NamedObj, whose value is an &lt;a href=&quot;../../../ptolemy/data/ObjectToken.xml&quot;&gt;ptolemy.data.ObjectToken&lt;/a&gt; containing the&#10; NamedObj as its value.  </description>
