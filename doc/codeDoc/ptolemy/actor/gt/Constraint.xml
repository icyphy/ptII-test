  <description>
Constraint used to restrict pattern matching in model transformations. A&#10; constraint contains an expression that must be evaluable into a boolean at the&#10; time the transformation rule is applied. When the expression is specified at&#10; design time, it is parsed and a syntax tree is generated. If the parsing is not&#10; successful, a design time exception occurs. If the parse is successful, the&#10; constraint is evaluated every time a match to the pattern is found. No&#10; exception will be shown at the time of pattern matching even if the constraint&#10; cannot be successfully evaluated. In that case, the constraint will only be&#10; considered &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;. A constraint is satisfied if and only if it can be&#10; successfully evaluated and the result is boolean &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;.  </description>
