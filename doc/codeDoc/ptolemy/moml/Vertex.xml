  <description>
This attribute represents a waypoint in a relation. It extends&#10; Location, meaning that can be associated with a physical location&#10; in a visual rendition.  It can optionally be associated with another&#10; instance of Vertex to indicate that there is a path from this&#10; one to the other one. Cyclic paths are not permitted, although&#10; currently that is not enforced by this class.  </description>
