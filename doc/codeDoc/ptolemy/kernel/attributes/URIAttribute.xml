  <description>
An attribute that identifies the URI from which the container was read.&#10; This attribute is not persistent by default.  That is, it exports no&#10; MoML description. This makes sense because it should be set by the&#10; code that reads the container's specification.  It is also a singleton,&#10; meaning that it will replace any previous attribute that has the same&#10; name and is an instance of the base class, SingletonAttribute.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; In most cases, this URI will specify a URL.  The difference between&#10; a URL and a URI is that a URI is unevaluated. That is, it is a string&#10; representation of a resource, without any assurance or indication of a&#10; file, stream, or other associated network resource.  To access a URI,&#10; it is common to create a URL from its specification.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, URLs are not necessarily valid URIs.  For example, a&#10; URL that has a space in it is not a valid URI, the space must be&#10; quoted (converted) to &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt;.  </description>
