  <description>
An attribute that represents the center location of a node in a&#10; schematic.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;By default, an instance of this class is not visible in a user&#10; interface.  This is indicated to the user interface by returning NONE&#10; to the getVisibility() method.  The location is specified by calling&#10; setExpression() with a string that has the form &quot;x,y&quot; or &quot;[x,y]&quot; or&#10; &quot;{x,y}&quot;, where x and y can be parsed into doubles.&#10;&#10; &lt;p&gt;The default location is a two dimensional location with value {0.0, 0.0}.&#10; This class can also handle locations with greater than two dimensions.  </description>
