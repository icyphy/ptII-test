  <description>
An Entity is a vertex in a generalized graph. It is an aggregation&#10; of ports. The ports can be linked to relations. The&#10; relations thus represent connections between ports, and hence,&#10; connections between entities. To add a port to an entity, simply&#10; set its container to the entity.  To remove it, set its container&#10; to null, or to some other entity.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Entities are intended for flat graphs. Derived classes support&#10; hierarchy (clustered graphs) by defining entities that aggregate&#10; other entities.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; An Entity can contain any instance of Port.  Derived classes may&#10; wish to constrain to a subclass of Port.  To do this, subclasses&#10; should override the public method newPort() to create a port of&#10; the appropriate subclass, and the protected method _addPort() to throw&#10; an exception if its argument is a port that is not of the appropriate&#10; subclass.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; An Entity is created within a workspace.  If the workspace is&#10; not specified as a constructor argument, then the default workspace&#10; is used. The workspace is used to synchronize simultaneous accesses&#10; to a topology from multiple threads.  The workspace is immutable&#10; (it cannot be changed during the lifetime of the Entity).  </description>
