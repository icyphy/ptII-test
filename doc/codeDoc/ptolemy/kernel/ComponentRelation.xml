  <description>
This class defines a relation supporting hierarchy (clustered graphs).&#10; Specifically, a method is added for defining a container and for&#10; performing deep traversals of&#10; a graph. Most importantly, however, instances of this class refuse to link&#10; to ports that are not instances of ComponentPort.  Thus, this class&#10; ensures that ComponentPort instances are only connected to other&#10; ComponentPort instances.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Derived classes may wish to further constrain linked ports to a subclass&#10; of ComponentPort, or to disallow links under other circumstances,&#10; for example if the relation cannot support any more links.&#10; Such derived classes should override the protected method _checkPort()&#10; to throw an exception.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; To link a ComponentPort to a ComponentRelation, use the link() or&#10; liberalLink() method in the ComponentPort class.  To remove a link,&#10; use the unlink() method.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The container for instances of this class can only be instances of&#10; ComponentEntity.  Derived classes may wish to further constrain the&#10; container to subclasses of ComponentEntity.  To do this, they should&#10; override the protected _checkContainer() method.  </description>
