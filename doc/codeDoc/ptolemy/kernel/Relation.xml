A Relation links ports, and therefore the entities that contain them.&#10; To link a port to a relation, use the link() method&#10; in the Port class.  To remove a link, use the unlink() method in the&#10; Port class.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Relations can also be linked to other Relations.&#10; To create such a link, use the link() method of this class.&#10; To remove such a link, use the unlink() method. A group of linked&#10; relations behaves exactly as if it were one relation directly linked&#10; to all the ports linked to by each relation. In particular, the&#10; connectedPortList() method of the Port class returns the same list&#10; whether a single relation is used or a relation group. The order&#10; in which the ports are listed is the order in which links were&#10; made between the port and relations in the relation group.&#10; It is not relevant which relation in a relation group the port&#10; links to.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Derived classes may wish to disallow links under certain circumstances,&#10; for example if the proposed port is not an instance of an appropriate&#10; subclass of Port, or if the relation cannot support any more links.&#10; Such derived classes should override the protected method _checkPort()&#10; or _checkRelation() to throw an exception.  </description>
