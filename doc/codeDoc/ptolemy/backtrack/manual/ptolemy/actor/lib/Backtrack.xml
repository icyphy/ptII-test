  <description>
This actor provides the interface to the backtracking mechanism. It is able to&#10; create checkpoints (in which case a checkpoint handle is returned) and roll&#10; back to previously created checkpoints.&#10;&#10; This actor has a &quot;checkpoint&quot; input port. It takes a boolean token in every&#10; firing, which means whether a checkpoint should be created. If it is true, a&#10; checkpoint will be created in the firing, and the checkpoint handle (a long&#10; number) will be output to the &quot;handle&quot; output port; otherwise, no output value&#10; will be sent to the &quot;handle&quot; port. The &quot;rollback&quot; input port takes a checkpoint&#10; handle (a long number) in each firing. If the handle is greater than 0, a&#10; rollback operation will be performed, and the whole model, including its&#10; hierarchical components if any, restores its previous state recorded for that&#10; checkpoint; if the given checkpoint handle is equal to or less than 0, the&#10; rollback operation will not be performed.  </description>
