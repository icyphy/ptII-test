&lt;p&gt;Record all input tokens for later querying.  This actor can be used for&#10; testing configurations of actors.  It can also be used in programs that&#10; invoke Ptolemy models and wish to query the results after the model&#10; is run.  The input tokens are read in the postfire() method so that&#10; in domains with fixed-point semantics, only the final, settled value&#10; is recorded.  The current time is also recorded for each value.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#10; The &lt;i&gt;capacity&lt;/i&gt; parameter limits the size of the record.&#10; If the capacity is set to zero, then no tokens are recorded, but&#10; the total number of input tokens is counted.  You can access&#10; the count via the getCount() method.  If the capacity is 1,&#10; then only the most recently seen token on each channel is recorded.&#10; If the capacity is negative (the default), then the capacity&#10; is infinite.&lt;/p&gt;  </description>
