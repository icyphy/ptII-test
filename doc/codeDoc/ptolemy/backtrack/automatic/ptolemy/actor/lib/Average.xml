&lt;p&gt;Output the average of the inputs after the last time a true token is&#10; received at the reset port.&#10; One output is produced each time the actor is fired.&#10; The inputs and outputs can be any token type that&#10; supports addition and division by an integer.  The output type is&#10; constrained to be the same as the input type.&#10; Note that if the input is an integer, then the output is an&#10; integer, which may not be what you want. You may need to set&#10; the input and output ports to double to force the result to be&#10; a double.&lt;/p&gt;&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note that the type system will fail to catch some errors. Static type&#10; checking may result in a resolved type that does not support addition&#10; and division.  In this case, a run-time error will occur.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;  </description>
