  <description>
The adapter for DE receiver.&#10; This class generates the DE-specific methods for the director.&#10; Those methods are : get, hasToken, put&#10; It also deals with the type conversions.&#10;&#10; Note that for now the generated code is C Code. What we need&#10; to do later, is to call some non-languages-specific functions in here&#10; which are implemented in a specific C adapter.  </description>
