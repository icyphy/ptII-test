Represent ptolemy networks with Syntactic Graphs.&#10;   Syntactic Graphs represent ptolemy networks in a manner that&#10;   can be translated to a syntactical representation. In this&#10;   representative graph, representative nodes can be organized&#10;   as parallel compositions of nodes in series with feedback drawn&#10;   around the entire graph.  </description>
