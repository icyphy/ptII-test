  <description>
Represent ComponentPorts syntactically in SyntacticNodes.&#10;  Ports in models that can be interpreted as input or output&#10;  ports can be represented referentially by this object. The&#10;  semantic information about direction is not retained in the&#10;  reference but represented by the context of the reference in&#10;  an input or output list in a SyntacticTerm. Multiports are&#10;  split into series of SyntacticPorts. Bidirectional ports are&#10;  split into pairs of SyntacticPorts.&#10;  &lt;p&gt;  </description>
