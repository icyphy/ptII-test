This parameter, when inserted into a model or an opaque composite actor,&#10; causes all input ports to acquire an attribute that makes them display&#10; their contents on the screen.  This works by piggybacking on the&#10; initialize() method of the container to insert the relevant parameters&#10; into the ports. It also piggybacks on postfire() and wrapup() to issue&#10; a ChangeRequest, which causes a repaint of the screen in Vergil.&#10; To stop monitoring the queue contents, simply delete&#10; this attribute from the model.&#10; To use this one option is to instantiate an attribute of type&#10; ptolemy.vergil.actor.lib.MonitorReceiverContents  </description>
