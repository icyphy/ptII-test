  <description>
An icon that displays the name of the container in an appropriately&#10; sized box. Put this into a composite actor or in any actor to&#10; convert the icon for that actor into a simple box with the name&#10; of the actor instance. You will probably also want to set the&#10; actor instance to not display its name above its icon. You can&#10; do that via the Customize Name dialog (obtained by right clicking&#10; on the icon) or by creating a parameter named &quot;_hideName&quot; with&#10; value true.  </description>
