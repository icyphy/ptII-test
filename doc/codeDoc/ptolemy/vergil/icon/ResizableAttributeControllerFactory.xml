  <description>
This is attribute that produces a custom node controller for icons that&#10; can be interactively resized. It provides a context menu suitable for&#10; an attribute as well as an interactor that provides for resizing.&#10; To use this class, just insert it as an attribute inside&#10; a Ptolemy II attribute, and then right clicking on the icon for&#10; that object will result in the use of the controller specified&#10; here.  The instance by convention will be named &quot;_controllerFactory&quot;,&#10; but the only reason to enforce this is that only the first such&#10; controller factory found as an attribute will be used.&#10; It is a singleton, so placing it any container will replace any&#10; previous controller factory with the same name.  </description>
