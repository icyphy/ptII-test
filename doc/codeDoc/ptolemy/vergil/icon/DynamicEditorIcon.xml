  <description>
An icon that provides for the possibility that figures may be&#10; dynamically updated.  While some icons are generally 'static' and it&#10; is simplest to regenerate new figures when their attributes change,&#10; other icons are more 'dynamic'.  For instance, some icons might&#10; display live video or a live plot.  This icon provides some basic&#10; infrastructure for dealing with such cases.&#10;&#10; The main difficulty is that, by design, an icon cannot keep track of&#10; the figures it creates, otherwise there is a possibility for memory&#10; leaks or inconsistencies in the case of multiple views.  This class&#10; solves the problem by using a WeakReferences to keep track of&#10; generated figures.  These references do not prevent objects from being&#10; garbage collected.  This class also provides a 'safe' iterator that&#10; can be used to traverse the weak references without the normal&#10; associated nastiness.  </description>
