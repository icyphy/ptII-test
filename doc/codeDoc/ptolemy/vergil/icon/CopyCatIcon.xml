    <!--ptolemy.actor.gui.ColorAttribute-->
    <property name="echoBoxColor">Color of the echo boxes. This defaults to white.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="echos">The number of echos of the bounding box to draw. This is an&#10;  int that defaults to 2.</property>
    <!--ptolemy.data.expr.Parameter-->
    <property name="includeName">If true, include the name of the copied actor in the icon&#10;  if the name is included normally in its icon. NOTE: This&#10;  will not include the name if the inside actor does not&#10;  have an icon attribute, but only has an _iconDescription,&#10;  so it's far from perfect.  This is a boolean&#10;  that defaults to false.</property>
