  <description>
An icon is a visual representation of an entity. Three such visual&#10; representations are supported here.  A background figure is returned&#10; by the createBackgroundFigure() method.  This figure is specified by&#10; an attribute named &quot;_iconDescription&quot; of the container, if there is one.&#10; If there is no such attribute, then a default icon is used.&#10; The createFigure() method returns this same background figure, but&#10; decorated with a label giving the name of the container, unless the&#10; container contains a parameter named &quot;_hideName&quot; with value true.&#10; The createIcon() method returns a Swing icon given by an attribute named&#10; &quot;_smallIconDescription&quot;, if there is one.  If there is no such&#10; attribute, then the icon is simply a small representation of the&#10; background figure.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; The XML schema used in the &quot;_iconDescription&quot; and &quot;_smallIconDescription&quot;&#10; attributes is SVG (scalable vector graphics), although currently Diva&#10; only supports a small subset of SVG.  </description>
