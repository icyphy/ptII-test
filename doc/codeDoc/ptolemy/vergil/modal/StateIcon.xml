  <description>
An icon that displays the name of the container in an appropriately&#10; sized rounded box. This is designed to be contained by an instance&#10; of State, and if it is, and if the state is the initial state, then&#10; the rounded box will be bold. If it is a final state, then it will&#10; be double.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; By default, the icon will be filled with color white,&#10; unless the refinement name of the containing State is not empty,&#10; in which case it returns a light green.&#10; However, if this attribute contains a ColorParameter named &quot;fill&quot;,&#10; then the color of that color parameter is used instead.&#10; If not, but if the container is a State and contains a&#10; ColorAttribute named &quot;fill&quot;, then that color is used..  </description>
