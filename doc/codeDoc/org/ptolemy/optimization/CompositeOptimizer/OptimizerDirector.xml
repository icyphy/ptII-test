  <description>
This is a specialized director that fires the input SDF model&#10;  repeatedly for different values of the optimization variable.&#10;  The director stores the tokens from input ports and re-sends them&#10;  to the inside receivers for each execution of the inside composite.&#10;  The fire() method makes a call to Cobyla.FindMinimum, which is a&#10;  derivative-free optimizer that uses a sequential trust-region algorithm&#10;  with linear approximations.  </description>
