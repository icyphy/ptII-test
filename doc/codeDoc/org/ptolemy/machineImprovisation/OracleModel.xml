This modal model actor supports mirroring of its ports in its container&#10; (which is required to be a refinement of a state in a ModalModel).&#10; This in turn assures&#10; mirroring of ports in each of the refinements.&#10; &lt;p&gt;&#10; Note that this actor has no attributes of its own.&#10; Requests for attributes are delegated to the container.  </description>
