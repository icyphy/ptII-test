Publish incoming tokens to an XMPPGateway attribute, if present.&#10;  The input is allowed to be of arbitrary width and tokens that&#10;  arrive in parallel are sequentially published during a single firing.&#10;  If no XMPPGateway is present in the model, all tokens are consumed&#10;  but no further action is taken. The XMPP publish-subscribe mechanism&#10;  works with end-points called nodes. This actor publishes to the node&#10;  identified by the parameter NodeId. If no NodeId is specified,&#10;  nothing is published and this actor silently consumes all input&#10;  tokens.  </description>
