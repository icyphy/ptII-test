<div class="block">The Ptolemy-HLA co-simulation framework leverages two open source tools: 
 Ptolemy II and HLA/CERTI to enable construction in Ptolemy II of an HLA
 federate. 
 </p>
 <h2>About HLA</h2>
 <p>
 The High Level Architecture (HLA) [1][2] is a standard for distributed
 discrete-event simulation. A simulation in HLA is called an HLA
 federation. A federation is a collection of federates, typically modeling
 components in a system, interconnected by a Run Time Infrastructure (RTI).
 Each federate may be running on a different machine, and the RTI enables
 them to send each other time-stamped events and ensures that the time
 stamps respect DE semantics. The coordination between federates is handled
 by a process called the RTIG, for RTI Gateway, which may be running
 on a remote machine. Specifically, time advance in each of the
 federates is coordinated by the RTIG so that events never arrive with time stamps
 that are in the past with respect to the current time of the federate.
 In Ptolemy II, a federate is a DE model with an instance of this HlaManager.
 The model can contain composite actors with other models of computation, using
 the ContinuousDirector for example.
 </p><p>
 This framework has been tested with an open-source RTI implementation
 called CERTI [4]. In principle, it should work with other RTI implementations.
 CERTI is implemented in C++, and an API called JCERTI is provided for Java.
 Ptolemy II uses JCERTI.  CERTI also provides a Python API, so in principle,
 a Ptolemy II federate should be able to interact with a federate written
 in Python. For more about CERTI, see:
 <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi" target="_top">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi</a>.
 </p>
 <h2>Creating a Federate</h2>
 <p>
 To create a federate, in a Ptolemy model with a DE director, instantiate
 an instance of this HLAManager. You will need to set the federationName
 parameter to the name of the federation and
 the <i>federateName</i> parameter to a unique name for the federate (unique
 to the federation).
 If, when running the model, there is no federation with the specified
 name, then a federation with that name will be automatically created.
 Otherwise, the federate will join the pre-existing federation.
 </p><p>
 Federates can exchange information using the <a href="../../../org/hlacerti/lib/HlaPublisher.html" title="class in org.hlacerti.lib"><code>HlaPublisher</code></a>
 and <a href="../../../org/hlacerti/lib/HlaSubscriber.html" title="class in org.hlacerti.lib"><code>HlaSubscriber</code></a> actors. When a time-stamped event in one
 federate is fed into an HlaPublisher, then a corresponding time-stamped
 event will pop out of any HlaSubscriber elsewhere in the federation
 if the parameters of that HlaSubscriber match those of the
 HlaPublisher. These parameters conform to a
 Federation Object Model (FOM) that is an important part of the
 definition of a federation and is described in a file called a
 Federation Execution Data (FED) file that needs to be
 available to this HlaManager. More about this later.
 </p>
 <h2>Time-Stamped Communication</h2>
 <p>
 When a time-stamped event is sent from one federate to another
 through the RTI,
 the relationship of the received time stamp compared to the sent
 time stamp depends on the parameters of the two HlaManagers at
 each end of the communication.
 First, the parameter <i>timeManagementService</i> selects between two
 styles called "Next Event Request (NER)" and
 "Time Advancement Request (TAR)".
 We explain these in order.
 </p><p>
 The NER style is the default, and it is the most natural for use
 with DE models. When <i>timeManagementService</i> specifies NER at both
 the sending and receiving federate, then
 the received time stamp is simply equal to the sent time stamp
 plus the value of the <i>hlaLookahead</i> parameter of the sending
 federate. So logically, there
 is a "model-time delay" equal to <i>hlaLookahead</i> in each
 communication.  The <i>hlaLookahead</i> is required to be strictly
 greater than zero (this significantly simplifies distributed
 coordination).
 </p><p>
 It rarely makes sense in a DE federate to use the TAR style,
 and the result of using it is much more complicated.
 The easiest way to understand the effect is to consider that
 the time stamp may be modified first at the sending federate
 and then again at the receiving federate. If the sending
 federate is NER, then it simply increments the time stamp
 by its <i>hlaLookahead</i>. If the receiving federate is NER, then
 it makes no modification to the received time stamp. It uses whatever
 it receives. Hence, if both ends are NER, the total modification
 to the time stamp is to increment it by the <i>hlaLookahead</i> value at the sender.
 But the situation is much more complicated if either end
 uses TAR.
 </p><p>
 Suppose a sending federate is using TAR. In this case,
 both <i>hlaLookahead</i> and the <i>hlaTimeStep</i> parameter may affect
 the time stamp. Specifically, if the sender has an event
 with time stamp equal to or greater than
 <i>N</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> and less than
 <i>N</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> plus <i>hlaLookahead</i>, 
 for any integer <i>N</i>, then the
 time stamp will be modified by the sender to equal
 <i>N</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> plus <i>hlaLookahead</i>.
 Otherwise, the time stamp is unmodified by the sender.
 </p><p>
 For example, if the sender has <i>hlaTimeStep</i> = 10 and
 <i>hlaLookahead</i> = 2 and it wishes to send an event with
 time stamp 1, the time stamp will be modified to 2,
 introducing a delay of 1.
 If it wants to send an event with time stamp 11,
 the time stamp will be modified to 12.
 </p><p>
 Suppose a receiving federate is using TAR. In this
 case, the time stamp of any incoming event will be
 modified to equal the next largest (or equal)
 multiple of the receiver's <i>hlaTimeStep</i>, i.e.
 <i>M</i> times <i>hlaTimeStep</i> for some integer <i>M</i>.
 </p><p>
 For example, if a receiving federate of the previous message
 whose time stamp was modified to 2 uses TAR with
 <i>hlaTimeStep</i> = 5, then the time stamp will be modified
 from 2 to 5, thereby getting a total delay of 4.
 If the receiving federate uses NER, on the other
 hand, the time stamp will not be modified by the receiver.
 It will be received with time stamp 2.
 </p><p>
 If the sending federate is using NER and the receiving federate
 is using TAR, then the sending federate will first modify the
 time stamp by adding its <i>hlaLookahead</i> to the time stamp,
 and then the receiving federate will further modify the time
 stamp to make it equal to the least larger multiple of its
 <i>hlaTimeStep</i>.
 </p>
 <h2>Exchanging Data</h2>
 <p>
 In HLA, the data that is sent from one federate to another through
 the RTI is viewed
 as an update to an attribute of an instance of a class.
 <a href="../../../org/hlacerti/lib/HlaPublisher.html" title="class in org.hlacerti.lib"><code>HlaPublisher</code></a> and <a href="../../../org/hlacerti/lib/HlaSubscriber.html" title="class in org.hlacerti.lib"><code>HlaSubscriber</code></a> actors specify
 which attribute of which instance of which class they update
 or are notified of updates.
 See the documentation for those two actors.
 </p><p>
 A Federation requires a Federation Execution Data (FED) file [7],
 which defines classes and specifies which attributes a class contains.
 The location of the FED file is given by two parameters of
 this HlaManager, <i>fedFile</i> and <i>fedFileOnRTIG</i>.
 Unfortunately, in HLA, the FED file is not a networked resource,
 and it is needed by both the Ptolemy II federate and the RTIG,
 and these may not be running on the same machine. So the locations
 of the two files may be different.
 By default, <i>fedFileOnRTIG</i> is set to "$fedFile", which
 makes it the same as whatever you specify in the <i>fedFile</i>
 parameter. This will usually work if the RTIG is being run
 on the same machine as the federate, and will always work
 the federate itself launches the RTIG by setting the
 <i>launchRTIG</i> parameter.
 </p>
 <h2>Environment Variables</h2>
 <p>
 CERTI, which is the implementation of HLA that Ptolemy II uses,
 relies on some environment variables to execute. The first and most
 important is CERTI_HOST, which provides the location of the machine
 that hosts the RTIG. To set it, before launching Ptolemy II,
 you can execute a command like:
 <pre>
    export CERTI_HOST=localhost
 </pre>
 This specifies that the RTIG host is the local machine.
 If you are connecting to a remote RTIG, you can instead specify the
 IP address or domain name of that machine.
 </p><p>
 The second environment variable is CERTI_HOME, but this one is required
 only if you wish the federate to launch an RTIG, something you specify
 with the <i>launchRTIG</i> parameter.  If you wish the federate to launch
 an RTIG, then you must set CERTI_HOME equal to the path to your
 installation of CERTI, and you must set your PATH environment variable
 to include the share/scripts and bin directories of your CERTI installation.
 </p><p>
 Sometime in the future, these environment variables may be replaced
 or supplemented by parameters added to this HlaManager.
 See also the <a href="../../../org/hlacerti/lib/CertiRtig.html" title="class in org.hlacerti.lib"><code>CertiRtig</code></a> class.
 </p>
 <h2>Lifecycle of Execution of a Federate</h2>
 <p>
 When a Ptolemy II federate starts executing, this HlaManager attempts
 to connect to an RTIG running on the host specified by CERT_HOST.
 If this fails, and if <i>launchRTIG</i>
 is set to true and CERT_HOST is either "localhost" or "127.0.0.1",
 then this HlaManager will attempt to launch an RTIG on the local
 machine.  This will require that the rtig executable be in your
 PATH and that CERTI_HOME be specified, as explained above.
 </p><p>
 Once the federate has connected to the RTIG, it will attempt to
 join the federation whose name is given by <i>federationName</i>.
 If there is no such federation, then it will create it and then
 join it.
 </p><p>
 After joining the federation, if <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> is
 not empty, then it will stall the execution until the
 synchronization point named in <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> is
 reached by all federates in the federation.
 If <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> is the same as <i>federateName</i>,
 then it is <i>this</i> federate that registers the synchronization
 point with the HLA. In that case, this federate should be last one launched.
 All other federates that name this federate in their
 <i>synchronizeStartTo</i> parameters will be waiting for
 a message from the RTIG when all federates have reached this point, 
 and now the coordinated simulation can begin.
 <b>NOTE:</b> If any federate fails to reach this synchronization point,
 then the entire federation will be frozen in its initialization.
 Consequently, <i>every</i> federate must have the same value for
 <i>synchronizeStartTo</i>.
 </p><p>
 The simulation then executes like a normal DE simulation, except
 that it may be stalled waiting for the RTI to permit time to advance.
 This HlaManager implements the Ptolemy II TimeRegulator interface,
 which enables it to regulate the advancement of time in the DEDirector.
 The parameters <i>isTimeConstrained</i> and <i>isTimeRegulator</i> can be used
 to decouple the advancement of time of the DEDirector from that of the RTI,
 but this is rarely a good idea. For more details about time management
 during execution, see [8].
 </p><p>
 The DEDirector in the model is required to have a finite <i>stopTime</i>
 parameter set. It is usually also a good idea to set its
 <i>stopWhenQueueIsEmpty</i> parameter to false, particularly if it
 is relying on an HlaSubscriber actor to provide it with events to process.
 Otherwise, the federate may prematurely finish its simulation.
 </p><p>
 When the simulation ends, the federate resigns from the federation.
 When all federates have resigned, the last federate destroys the federation.
 In addition, if one of the federates launched the RTIG, and if
 that federate's <i>killRTIG</i> parameter is set to true, then
 that federate will also kill the RTIG.
 </p><p>
 This HlaManager provides extensive debug output. Listen to the attribute to get
 the details. Some of these messages, primarily those related to the lifecycle of
 the interaction with the RTI, are also printed to standard out, even if you are
 listening to the attribute.
