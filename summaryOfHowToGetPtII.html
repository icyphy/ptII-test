    <h3><a name="javaversion">Install Java</a></h3>
    Ptolemy II requires JDK 1.8. or later.
    For details, see <code>$PTII/doc/install.htm</code>.

    <br><code>ptII/doc/install.java</code> in the source
    tree you have just downloaded more fully describes
    what packages to install.
    <p>The quick Java installation instructions:
      <ol>
        <li>Install the latest JDK from
          <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp"><code>http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</code></a>
          <br>Oracle calls the JDK various names: JDK 8 or Java SE 8 or JDK1.8.
          <br> The installation should end up in a directory
          like <code>c:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0</code>

      </ol>

      <h3><a name="build">Build instructions</a></h3>

    <p>You have now checked out the source code!  But it still needs to
      be compiled.  First you will need to set some environment variables.
      These may be set locally in the shell, or globally via a Windows
      dialog box.

    <p>To set the environment variables in a C shell, first cd to the
      directory (such as your home directory) where your ptII directory
      lives.  Then use the following commands:

      <pre>
        setenv HOME `pwd`
        setenv PTII `pwd`/ptII
      </pre>
      To set them in a Bash shell:
      <pre>
        export HOME=c:/directoryOfYourChoice
        export PTII=c:/directoryOfYourChoice/ptII
      </pre>

      The <code>export</code> commands above are useful if you will be creating
      subprocesses of your Bash shell.  Anyway, they don't hurt.

	      <h4>Cygwin directory mapping</h4>
	      <p>Note that Cygwin remaps directories, so <code>d:\tmp</code>
	        may appear as <code>/cygdrive/d/tmp</code>.

	      <p>Unfortunately, the <code>java</code> command
	        does not understand the Cygwin <code>/cygdrive</code> notation,
	        so <code>java</code> may not find the files it needs.

	      <p>For example, <code>pwd</code>
	        returns <code>/cygrive/d/tmp/ptII</code>, which will not work
	        with <code>java</code>:
	        <pre>
	          cxh@MOWAT-171 /cygdrive/d/tmp/ptII
	          $ PTII=d:\\tmp\\ptII

	          cxh@MOWAT-171 /cygdrive/d/tmp/ptII
	          $ echo $PTII
	          d:\tmp\ptII

	          cxh@MOWAT-171 /cygdrive/d/tmp/ptII
	          $ cd $PTII

	          cxh@MOWAT-171 /cygdrive/d/tmp/ptII
	          $ pwd
	          /cygdrive/d/tmp/ptII
	        </pre>

	        So, under Cygwin, it is best to avoid using pwd when setting
	        variables.  Avoid:
	        <pre>
	          PTII=`pwd`/ptII
	        </pre>
	        and use
	        <pre>
	          PTII=d:\\tmp\\ptII
	        </pre>
	        instead. 

	      <p>An alternative is to use the <code>cygpath</code> command.
	        <pre>
	          export PTII=`cygpath -m ${PWD}`
	        </pre>
	        This results in a path that has forward slashes.  Formerly, under
	        Windows, Java would not work well with forward slashes, but that
	        problem seems to be fixed in Java 1.7.

In either shell, you may also wish to set your path to include
<code>c:\directoryofyourchoice\ptII\bin</code> (where vergil lives) and
<code>c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin</code> or wherever your java installation is located.

<p>To set environment variables in Windows, do Start -> Settings
  -> Control Panel -> System.  Click the Advanced tab and then
  the Environment Variables button.

  Set up the following under the heading
  <code>User variables for <i>yourlogin</i></code>
  <pre>
    Variable    Value
    HOME        c:\directoryofyourchoice
    PTII        c:\directoryofyourchoice\ptII
</pre><p>


  Under System Variables, augment your Path variable.  Edit it,
  and add <code>c:\<I>directoryofyourchoice</I>\ptII\bin;</code> in front of the
  existing text in the Variable Value window.  You may also wish to
  add something like <code>c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\bin;</code> to point to the java
  installation you want Ptolemy II to use.  Otherwise, the one in your
  WINNT/System32 directory may be used. <p>

  If you have used the Windows dialog to set the environment variables,
  you will need to open a new shell in order to have them take effect.
  On the other hand, if you have set them from within the shell, do not
  open a new one.  New shells will not have the variables set.<p>

  You are now ready to compile Ptolemy II!  First you configure.  To use
  the default java instalation on your system, simply type the following
  command:

  <pre>
    ./configure
  </pre>

<p>The <code>./</code> in the above command is needed to convince the
  shell that you really do want to execute configure as a command, even
  though your current working directory may not be on your path.  If you
  wish to control the exact java used, you may specify it with a command
  like the following instead:</p>

<pre>
  ./configure --with-java=c:/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1..0
</pre>

<p>Note that --with-java is not well supported, and you are better off
  having your path properly set up so that the version of java you would
  like Ptolemy II to use is first in your path.</p>

<p>Which ever form you use, it grinds briefly.  Some warnings or errors
  are normal.  Mostly they indicate optional adjuncts to Ptolemy II
  which were not installed.</p>

<p>The next step is to run make:</p>
<pre>
  make fast all
</pre>
<p>  The <code>all</code> directive isn't strictly necessary, since
  <code>all</code> is the default.  The <code>fast</code> directive
  speeds compilation of multiple java files.  It causes many java files
  to be loaded into the compiler at once, instead of re-invoking the
  compiler for each java file.</p>

<p>You're done!!  You can type now <code>vergil</code> (or
  <code>$PTII/bin/vergil</code> if you did not set your path) in the C
  shell or cygwin Bash window and it should start up!</p>

<p>Note that if your <code>$PTII</code> path includes spaces,
  then try </p>
<pre>
  "$PTII/bin/vergil"
</pre>


<p>To update your tree and get any updates, do:</p>
<pre>
  cd $PTII
  git pull
  ./configure
  $PTII/bin/ant
</pre>
